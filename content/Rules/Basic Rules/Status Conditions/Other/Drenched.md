**Type**: N/A

A creature gains the drenched condition when they have been completely covered or submerged in water, or a similar liquid. While drenched the affected creature gains vulnerability to cold and electric damage but takes half damage from non-electrical fire. Unless otherwise specified the drenched condition can last up to an hour, or be removed early upon taking an instance of fire, electric, or cold damage. Some spells may specify further interaction with the drenched condition.
