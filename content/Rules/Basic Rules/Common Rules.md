title: Common Rules
---

This page details a number of common rules a player may run into. This is similar to a FAQ of overarching rules that should be applied in every scenario possible.

## Always Round Down

Unless otherwise specified this system assumes a creature will always round down to the nearest whole number when dealing with anything that would result in a fraction or decimal. The best example of this is BAB when a character with 1.25, 1.5, or even 1.75 BAB regardless is treated as having a 1 BAB.

## Specific Overrides General

If an ability or feature would override a rule of the system it is assumed it will always take precedence over the higher rule.

The heirarchy is effectively as follows, going from most general to most specific:

- System rules
- Class features
- feats
- spells

## Default AP Cost

If an ability somehow fails to specify its AP cost, and is not a passive effect, unless otherwise clarified it should just be assumed the ability has a 3 AP cost to activate.
