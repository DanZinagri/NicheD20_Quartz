The DC of the zombie plague varies based on the hit dice of the carrier (usually a human zombie).

Onset_Time: 1d2days
Onset_Effect: Subject gains the fatigued condition.
Cure: 3 saves
Frequency: 1/day
Save_Type: Resilience(End)
Effect: "1d4 End drain; this drain cannot be removed until the creature is cured of the plague. **Note**: Zombie Plague can only infect humans; creatures that are slain with, or die from, Zombie Plague rise again gaining the zombie class in 2d4 minutes."
