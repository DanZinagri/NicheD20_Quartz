Niche is a turn-based system meaning that during combat players and the creatures they fight against each are given a turn to perform a number of actions before moving to the next creature's turn.

At a high level combat follows the following flow:

1. Once combat has begun all creatures must first roll their initiative.
2. Determine if any creatures would be unaware and therefore surprised.
3. Creatures go in sequence of highest to lowest initiative.
4. After all creatures have taken their action a new round occurs starting again at the top of the list.
5. Repeat 3 and 4 until combat has ended.
