## Spells

Spells are the representation of the magic a character is capable of utilizing. Each magic class has the ability to gain spells and talents.

Some casters learn spells and talents permanently similar to feats as they gain levels in classes, these are chosen using their talents gained per level as a talent slot can know a spell or talent, in addition various classes gain bonus spells which can only be used to grab a spell rather than a spell or talent. Other casters use these talents as a variable source of casting each day, filling these talent positions each morning by drawing power from, or studying, a spell source. See the casting type section for more information.

All spells have some prerequisite or condition to be learned, usually simply having the appropriate elemental affinity talent known, though other prerequisites may exist such as a minimum BCB.

## Talents

At their base most talents are a part of a spell, allowing a base spell to be modified in different ways, either granting strength, utility, or simply new and creative uses for a spell. Talents are applied to the spell as a whole. A spell is assembled with the spell as the baseline and all talents it will utilize when cast, rather than the talents being permanently applied once learned. For prepared casters this assembly starts at the beginning of the day when the spell is determined ahead of time, while spontaneous casters simply assemble the spell and all desired talents at the point of casting. Once all talents are decided then all choices related to those talents, and spell point increases are calculated before the spell is able to cast.

## Universal talents

Universal talents are similar to normal spell talents, but can be applied across various spells. Some universal talents such as meta talents can be applied to almost any spell, while some shape talents may have restrictions on the type of spells they may be applied to.

Affinity talents are also a type of universal talent, but rather than being something to modify an existing talent are instead used as a baseline to allow access into a spell. These are labeled as universal talents simply due to not being attached to a specific spell, but rather being able to be taken/learned at any point using any available talents provided by their spellcasting class.

## Casting Spells and Talents

When casting a spell, you must assemble your spell first; this process involves selecting the base spell, and any talents you wish to use with the spell that would be valid for use with the spell, such as talents specific to the spell, affinity talents, and any meta or universal talents. Once all the talent selections have been made determine the spell point cost and any variable spell point costs that need to be determined when cast; some spells allow for additional spell point costs to be spent after casting had occurred such as spells that allow spending a spell point to allow a spell to continue without concentration.

Once a spell has been assembled and the spell point costs determined the spell can be cast and the spell point costs can be paid.

Assembling a spell is a process that generally occurs for both spontaneous and prepared casters, but at a high level the difference is if the assembly is occurring at the point of casting or earlier in the day; though certain additional differences exist between these types (see Casting Type section).
