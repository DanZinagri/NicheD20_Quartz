title: Casting Origin
---
A Casting Origin determines the style of casting utilized by a caster, greatly defining the rules and restrictions of their casting, alongside any benefits and capabilities of the caster. At a high level this defines both the theming and the rules for how a caster goes about conjuring their magics. While the general rules of the magic system are still at play, these may alter, limit, or further define how a caster works.

A caster choses their Casting Origin when they first gain the casting feature. This cannot be changed once selected. A Casting Origin not only defines thematic restrictions and rules for a caster, but also determines what spells they may learn. This may be a caster receiving healing magics from a divine power, someone inscribing rules and sigils to alter the world around them, or even a caster drawing power from the world around themselves to fuel their destructive powers.

In addition to these restrictions, a Casting Origin will usually define if an Origin's [Casting Type](../Casting%20Type.md); defining their utilization of spontaneous or prepared spellcasting.

A GM may decide to limit this selection for the sake of worldbuilding to grant only a few options to players, as a style of casting may be more thematic to a setting than another.
