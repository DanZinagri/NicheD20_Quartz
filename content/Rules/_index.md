In this section are the various rules. Basic rules to cover general circumstances as well as base concepts for a player. Combat rules to cover the various actions and interactions in combat. Magic rules to define the rules specific to those looking to play a magic casting class. Beyond these are other potentially useful rules for your game.

If a situation does not have a rule covered it is usually recommended to find its next best equivalent scenario in another rule, otherwise such scenarios always will come down to GM discretion in how the scenario will play out.
