Optional Rules are rules are usually rules that can be added to the game without much impact on the basic rules of the game, usually in the form of rules that easily can be implemented but were not made core to the system due to them not being right for all groups, either through the extra information to be tracked, or further adjusting the pace of the game in a way that not all players may enjoy.
