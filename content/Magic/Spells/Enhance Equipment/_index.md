description: "You may grant an enhancement bonus to a piece of equipment (Usually a weapon, shield, suit of armor, implement, or tool) for as long as you concentrate, or you can spend a spell point to allow the spell to continue without concentration for 10 minutes per BCB.\r\rThe equipment gains a +1 enhancement bonus, plus an additional +1 at 4 BCB and every 4 BCB thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 20 BCB). This does not stack with any enhancement bonuses the equipment already has; instead using the higher of the two enhancement bonuses."
