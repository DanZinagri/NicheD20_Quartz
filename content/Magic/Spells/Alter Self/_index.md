description: "Upon casting this spell can alter yourself for as long as you concentrate or may spend a spell point to allow the spell to continue without concentration for 1 minute per BCB. The spell may be dismissed as a 3 AP action.\r\rWhen using alter self the caster applies a series of traits to themself. Traits available are determined by Alter and Form talents the caster possesses. The traits themselves do not change a creature’s base physical form, but instead augment them with their special characteristics (such as natural attacks, vision, movement modes, size adjustments, and more). The caster may grant a maximum number of traits to themselves equal to 2 + 1 per 5 BCB and cannot grant the same trait more than once unless specified otherwise. These traits may be selected from any Alter or Form talent they possess and do not require all traits to be chosen from the same talent.\r\rTraits that grant a limb already possessed by your exisiting form may either grant the additional limb; or you may choose choose not to but still gain any benefits related to gaining that limb; such as natural weapons or movement modes. If you already possess that benefit this trait then has no effect; such as granting a natural attack to a limb that already possessed it, or a movement mode already granted to you."
Special: When you gain this spell, if you don’t already have one, select a single form or alter universal talent that you qualify for (if you do not qualify for any form talents you cannot select this spell). For the purposes of prepared casters this spell does not take a slot to prepare, but also cannot be used without a form talent prepared, form and alter talents take up slots as normal.
