This spell lasts for 1 round per BCB, but you may spend 1 spell point to allow the spell to last 1 minute per BCB. The effects of this spell are determined by the aura type talent applied to it, and may only have one telekinetic aura type talent applied to it.

In addition your orbit now can orbit beyond directly around you, allowing it to orbit up to 5 feet, plus an additional 5 feet per 3 BCB, allowing you to move objects across the battlefield and even hand them off to allies at a range (requiring the ally to spend a 2 AP action still to take the item from you on their turn). The save penalty against sunder and disarm maneuvers increases by 1 for every 5 feet the object is from you. When making thrown attacks within the area of your orbit, as long as the attack resolves within the radius of your orbit you may cause the weapon to return to your hand after the attack resolves; attacks outside this radius cannot return. Weapon attacks with ranged weapons treat their distance shot/thrown as a number of feet shorter, equal to the radius of the orbit, for the purposes of determining range increments the weapon has traveled, as the orbit helps propel forward your attacks without loss of potency from distance.</td></tr></tbody></table></span></p><h2><span><p dir="auto">Telekinetic Sphere</p></span></h2><p><span dir="ltr" style="overflow-x: auto;"><table><tbody><tr><th dir="ltr">Spell</th><td dir="ltr">Telekinetic Aura</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Prerequisite</th><td dir="ltr">Telekinetic Aura, Greater Aura, Telekinetic Orbit, Greater Orbit, Telekinetic Catch, Telekinetic Zone, BCB 16th</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Saving Throw</th><td dir="ltr">Resilience negates</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Benefit</th><td dir="ltr">When using Telekinetic Zone with Greater Orbit you begin to warp the gravity of the area.

A successful save attack causes all affected creatures within to treat their weight as 1/16th their normal weight, and are treated as two categories smaller for the purposes of determining their bonuses to MSB and saves against maneuvers from size. Creatures affected by this zone also reduce the total DC required to jump by half due to the reduced weight. A failed save attack allows the creature to choose if they are affected or not by the ability. In addition all objects within the zone have their weights also reduced by the same amount.</td></tr></tbody></table></span></p><h2><span><p dir="auto">Telekinetic Zone</p></span></h2><p><span dir="ltr" style="overflow-x: auto;"><table><tbody><tr><th dir="ltr">Spell</th><td dir="ltr">Telekinetic Aura</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Prerequisite</th><td dir="ltr">Telekinetic Aura, Greater Aura, Telekinetic Orbit, Telekinetic Catch, BCB 8th</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Benefit</th><td dir="ltr">When using Telekinetic Orbit and Telekinetic Catch as part of the same casting of Telekinetic Aura you spend an additional spell point to create an oppressive aura of telekinetic energy that makes it more difficult to move in.

Your orbit has a maximum encumbrance calculated at your BCB + your CAM treated as its strength score; the combined weight of all objects in your orbit cannot exceed the light load of this carry capacity. Objects in the orbit use your saves for the purposes of sunder checks and disarm attempts, but take a -2 penalty to their saves while within the orbit.
