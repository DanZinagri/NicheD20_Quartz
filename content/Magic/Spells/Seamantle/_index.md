This slam attack has a reach of 30 feet. In addition, as a 3 AP
action
, you can attempt to extinguish fires by touch. You automatically extinguish up to a 10-foot cube of normal fire. Against magical fire effects, your touch acts as
dispel magic
; this also applies to any non-instantaneous fire effect that comes into contact with you. Even if you fail to extinguish a fire, you are not harmed by it. </td></tr></tbody></table></span></p><h2><span><p dir="auto">Mobile Seamantle</p></span></h2><p><span dir="ltr" style="overflow-x: auto;"><table><tbody><tr><th dir="ltr">Spell</th><td dir="ltr">Seamantle</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Prerequisite</th><td dir="ltr">Seamantle, BCB 8th</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Benefit</th><td dir="ltr">You may choose to swim within your seamantle instead of walking. When doing so the seamantle moves at your normal swimming speed, but may be used to swim vertically into the air, allowing you effectively to fly while the spell is in effect.</td></tr></tbody></table></span></p><h2><span><p dir="auto">Protective Seamantle</p></span></h2><p><span dir="ltr" style="overflow-x: auto;"><table><tbody><tr><th dir="ltr">Spell</th><td dir="ltr">Seamantle</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Prerequisite</th><td dir="ltr">Seamantle</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Benefit</th><td dir="ltr">You may spend an additional spellpoint when casting seamantle to cause attacks against you to be treated as if you had cover against them. At 10th BCB you are instead treated as having improved cover, as if you were being attacked while below the surface of the water.
The cover granted by this talent does not enable you to make stealth checks. Magical attacks against you are unaffected unless they specifically would not work underwater. </td></tr></tbody></table></span></p><h2><span><p dir="auto">Tranquil Waters</p></span></h2><p><span dir="ltr" style="overflow-x: auto;"><table><tbody><tr><th dir="ltr">Spell</th><td dir="ltr">Seamantle</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Prerequisite</th><td dir="ltr">Seamantle</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Benefit</th><td dir="ltr">All water within the area of the seamantle are treated as calm water for the purposes of Athletics checks to swim. The cover bonus from seamantle when using this talent is reduced to cover from improved cover. This prevents sprays and blasts of mundane and magic water from striking with enough force to deal damage, move creatures or halt their movement, or perform any action that requires an attack roll or combat maneuver check.</td></tr></tbody></table></span></p><h2><span><p dir="auto">Water Globe</p></span></h2><p><span dir="ltr" style="overflow-x: auto;"><table><tbody><tr><th dir="ltr">Spell</th><td dir="ltr">Seamantle</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Prerequisite</th><td dir="ltr">Seamantle, BCB 4th</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Benefit</th><td dir="ltr">You may spend an additional spell point as part of casting seamantle to cause it to affect a radius of 20 feet around you.</td></tr></tbody></table></span></p>
