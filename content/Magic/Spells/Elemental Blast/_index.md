If the talents would target the same type of AC they use that value, but if they would target touch and normal AC the compound blast targets normal AC. Effects from the Blast Damage Type talents that would increase the damage by one step do not apply unless both talents would adjust the damage; the resulting damage is only adjusted by 1 step.
The damage type of the spell becomes a mix of both; resistant or would also possess DR for both damage types they take full damage from this spell. If a creature is vulnerable to one of these two damage types they are then weak to the entire blastï¿½s damage; if a creature is vulnerable to one of these two elements but resistant or immune against the other element they take normal damage instead.
The spell point costs of each effect talent must be paid separately for each desired effect. </td></tr></tbody></table></span></p><h2><span><p dir="auto">Focusing Beam</p></span></h2><p><span dir="ltr" style="overflow-x: auto;"><table><tbody><tr><th dir="ltr">Spell</th><td dir="ltr">Elemental Blast</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Prerequisite</th><td dir="ltr">Elemental Blast, BCB 5th</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Benefit</th><td dir="ltr">Your elemental blast may only target a single creature, but deals +1 damage per damage die rolled.</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Special</th><td dir="ltr">This talent may not be used in conjunction with shape talents or the spellstrike talent.</td></tr></tbody></table></span></p><span><span><hr></span></span><h1><span><p dir="auto">Blast Damage Type Talents</p></span></h1><span><span><hr></span></span><h2><span><p dir="auto">Decaying Miasma</p></span></h2><p><span dir="ltr" style="overflow-x: auto;"><table><tbody><tr><th dir="ltr">Spell</th><td dir="ltr">Elemental Blast</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Prerequisites</th><td dir="ltr">Decay(Nature-Anima) Affinity</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Saving Throw</th><td dir="ltr">Resilience(End)</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Benefit</th><td dir="ltr">Your Elemental Blast deals Decay damage and targets touch AC.
