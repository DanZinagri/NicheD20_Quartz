A successful save attack causes creatures within to fall prone.<br><br>This area is treated as difficult terrain for the duration of the spell. Creatures attempting to move through this area must make an acrobatics check against the save attack of this spell. If you succeed against their Acrobatics check by less than one degree of success the creature cannot move that round and must make a new Physical(Agi) save to avoid falling prone; one degree of success or more against the creatureâ€™s acrobatics check causes them to fall prone without a Physical(Agi) save.<br><br>Each square of ice slick is 1 inch thick with 1 hardness. Creatures may break the ice slick by dealing at least 3 points of damage to an individual square of the ice slick, but the ice returns each round if it remains within the area of the sleet storm.</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Prerequisite</th><td dir="ltr">Sleet Storm</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Saving throw</th><td dir="ltr">Physical(Agi) negates</td></tr></tbody></table></span></p><h2><span><p dir="auto">Ice Storm</p></span></h2><p><span dir="ltr" style="overflow-x: auto;"><table><tbody><tr><th dir="ltr">Spell</th><td dir="ltr">Sleet Storm</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Benefit</th><td dir="ltr">You may spend 1 spell point when casting sleet storm to improve it to an ice storm.
