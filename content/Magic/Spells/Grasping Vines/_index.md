title: Grasping Vines
keyword: Clinging, Conjuration
Prerequisites: Nature(Essence) Affinity
Target: Radius (10 feet + 5 feet per two BCB)
Duration: Concentration or 1 minute per BCB(see description)
Range: Close
Action: 4 AP
Saving Throw: Physical negates
Spell Resistance: No
Description: |-
  You must target an area with at least some grass, vines, or other vegetation. You cause plants to grow rapidly, wrapping themselves around everything within the targeted area. You make a Physical save attack against creatures in the area, on a success the creature gains the entangled condition and becomes unable to move. Creatures that succeed at their save can move as normal, but those that remain in the area must save again at the end of each turn the area persists. Creatures that move into the area must save immediately.
  Creatures that fail against your save attack end their movement and gain the entangled condition. Entangled creatures can break free as a 2 AP action, if they succeed at a sunder MSB check or Escape Artist check (against the original save attack for the spell). This area is also considered difficult terrain for the duration of the effect.
  This spell may be maintained through concentration, or the caster may spend a spell point to allow the spell to continue without concentration.

This spell must be cast upon a solid unattended surface.
If cast upon hard surfaces such as stone, marble or a similarly dense material, the sudden plant growth damages the terrain causing creatures within to treat their speed as 5 feet shorter (minimum 5 feet) in addition to the difficult terrain caused by Grasping Vines. The terrain no longer hampers movements once the spell ends. </td></tr></tbody></table></span></p><h2><span><p dir="auto">Sickening Vines</p></span></h2><p><span dir="ltr" style="overflow-x: auto;"><table><tbody><tr><th dir="ltr">Spell</th><td dir="ltr">Grasping Vines</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Prerequisite</th><td dir="ltr">Grasping Vines</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Keyword</th><td dir="ltr">Poison</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Benefit</th><td dir="ltr">Your vines are coated with an irritating sap that causes a painful, itching rash on creatures that touch them.
