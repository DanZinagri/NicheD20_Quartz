The target gains concealment (20% miss chance + an additional 2% per BCB to a maximum of 50%); attacks and spells requiring an attack roll have a chance to pass harmlessly through a portion of the illusion without hitting the target’s real body. Area spells and spells which do not require an attack roll are not affected by this miss chance.
<p dir="auto">The attacker must be able to see the illusion to be fooled. If the target is invisible, the attacker is blind, or the attacker would have some sort of special vision (such as blindsense or lifesense) capable of detecting the true location of the creature, the illusion has no effect.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p dir="auto"></p></span></p><h2><span><p dir="auto">Vanish</p></span></h2><p><span dir="ltr" style="overflow-x: auto;"><table><tbody><tr><th dir="ltr">Spell</th><td dir="ltr">Fade</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Prerequisite</th><td dir="ltr">Fade, BCB 2nd</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Action</th><td dir="ltr">4 AP</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Benefit</th><td dir="ltr">You may spend an additional spell point to allow the target to become invisible, gaining all the benefits associated with this status.
