Description: You may spend a spell point to lift an object, or number of objects, in your square or adjacent to you with this spell and throw it at an enemy. Objects thrown with this ability are treated as thrown weapons, though if not made for throwing they are treated as improvised thrown weapons; using the usual range increments and damage of such objects. You do not suffer the usual penalties for non-proficiency or improvised weapons when throwing objects with this spell. For each additional AP spent you may lift and throw one additional attack at a cumulative -5 penalty for each attack beyond the first. You may lift and throw an object two size categories up to yourself (such as a light weapon). At 5th BCB and every 5 thereafter the size category of items you may lift and throw improve by 1 step. You cannot lift objects attended by other creatures.
Special: You may choose to use your implement bonus to attack and damage rolls or the enhancement bonus of the object thrown if it possesses one, but cannot use both.
