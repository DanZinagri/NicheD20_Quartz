Until the effect ends, whenever the target is subject to a healing spell or supernatural effect that heals hit points, the target only receives half the healing(rounded down). Once you’ve prevented 5 hit points of healing per BCB with this spell, the spell is discharged.\r\r<br><br>You may spend 1 spell point as part of casting to cause the healing prevented by life thief to be redirected to you. You must remain within 25 feet + 5 feet per two BCB of the target to gain this benefit."
special: When applying a shape talent to this spell, you target creatures within the area with a Resilience(Psy) save attack. A failed Resilience(Psy) save attack negates the effects of the spell.

A failed Resilience(Psy) save attack deals half damage, and negates the effects of life thief if the caster chose to spend the additional spell point to apply the effects of life thief to the vampiric touch.</td></tr></tbody></table></span></p>
