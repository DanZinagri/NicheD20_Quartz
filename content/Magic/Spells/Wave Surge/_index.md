title: Wave Surge
keyword: Creation, Maneuver
Prerequisites: Water(Essence) Affinity, BCB 3rd
Target: (See Text)
Duration: 1 Round + 1 round per 5 BCB
Range: Close
Action: 4 AP
Saving Throw: (See text)
Spell Resistance: No
Description: |-
  You may spend a spell point to create a wave of water that starts at your location that moves 30 feet per round in a direction of your choosing to a maximum of close range. Creatures struck by the wave are subject to a trip maneuver using your BCB in place of your BAB and your CAM in place of your Strength for determining your MSB for this maneuver. On success the creatures struck are knocked prone, on one degree of success or higher they are also carried by the wave during the wave's movement for this round. You receive a +5 bonus to this check if the creature is already caught within the wave. Creatures may attempt a MSB or Athletics check to swim attempt a check, against the MSB of the spell, on their turn to escape the wave on their turn, though the creature is limited by their usual swim speed for how far they can swim out of the wave. Creatures within the wave may begin the suffocate if they cannot breathe in water and receive only half their usual time to hold their breath due to the battering motions of the wave.
  The wave is 10 feet high, 5 feet long, and 5 feet wide. Objects larger than the wave stop all movement of the wave and immediately end the spell, while creatures of larger size can still be tripped by the wave but not carried by it if they are larger than the wave.
  At 8th BCB you may spend an additional spell point when casting this spell to improve the size of the wave by an additional 5 feet in length, width, and height.
Special: If created in a square on top of existing water, that at least covers the entire square, reduce the AP cost of the spell by 1 (minimum 1); as you utilize the existing water instead of conjuring new water, moving the existing water.

When improved to a Tsunami the destructive force and size of the wave surge are drastically increased. A Tsunamiï¿½s speed improves to 60 feet per round, and creatures struck by the Tsunami take 8d6 points of water damage regardless if a success or failure of the combat maneuver check. The size of the Tsunami is improved to 2 feet tall per BCB, 10 feet wide per BCB, and a length of 20 feet. Due to the increase in size the Tsunami receives a +4 bonus to its CMB and CMD. Creatures who fail to escape the wave take 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage for each turn they fail to escape.</td></tr></tbody></table></span></p>
