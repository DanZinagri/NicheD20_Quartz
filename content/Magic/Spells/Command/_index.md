  You may spend a spell point to concentrate on a single creature. Each turn you may give the targeted creature a single command, which it obeys to the best of its ability from the following list
  Come: On its turn the creature moves towards you as quickly as possible for 1 round, taking no other action but moving during its turn. This movement may provoke attacks of opportunity as normal.
  Go: On its turn the creature moves away from you as quickly as possible for 1 round, taking no other action but moving during its turn. This movement may provoke attacks of opportunity as normal.
  Drop: On its turn the creature drops whatever it is holding. It may not pick up any dropped item on the same turn it dropped it.
  Fall: The subject falls prone on its turn. It may not stand up on the same turn, but may act normally while prone, taking penalties as normal.
  Halt: The subject stands in place for 1 round. It may not take any actions but is not treated as helpless.
  Kill: You give the target an urge to kill its nearest ally, which it obeys to the best of its ability. The target attacks its nearest ally on its turn with a melee attack. The target will move or charge to it�s nearest ally to make this attack, or will use its turn to get as close as possible if unable to..
  For the duration of the spell the creature receives a new Resilience(Psy) save to attempt to end the spell on each of its turns, forcing a new save attack from the caster each time. Each round the caster must spend a 2 AP action to give a new command even if it's the same command as the previous round. You may spend an additional spell point to allow the spell to continue without concentration.

If you and the target share a language, you can command them to perform as you desire, within certain limitations of its abilities. If you do not share a language, you can give simple commands such as "come", "go", "fight", "stay". You know what the target is experiencing, but have no sensory input from it, nor can it communicate. You may only have 2 HD of creatures dominated at once per BCB.
When giving a dominated creature a command, it will attempt to carry it out to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for their own survival (such as sleeping and eating). Due to this, a DC 15 sense motive can determine that the subject's behavior is being influenced. Changing orders or giving a new command is a 2 AP action; though you may give a command as part of the initial casting of dominate. Once control is established the spell has unlimited range as long as you and the target remain on the same plane, and you do not need to be able to see the target to control it.
You may spend a 3 AP action to receive full sensory input of the target; while still not allowing communication can grant the caster an idea of what is occuring with the dominated creature.
Unlike command creature�s do not receive a save reach round; instead when forced to take actions against its nature receive a new saving throw with a +2 bonus against the original save attack. Self-destructive orders are not carried out. Actions against its nature may include, betraying its allies, betraying its nation, giving up a valued possession, or similar actions. </td></tr></tbody></table></span></p><h2><span><p dir="auto">Grand Domination</p></span></h2><p><span dir="ltr" style="overflow-x: auto;"><table><tbody><tr><th dir="ltr">Spell</th><td dir="ltr">Command</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Prerequisite</th><td dir="ltr">Dominate, BCB 18th</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Benefit</th><td dir="ltr">You may use dominate on any creature regardless of type.

The suggestion must be considered reasonable by the creature (such as a creature continuing its work in a different location). A very reasonable suggestion causes the save attack to gain a +1 or 2 bonus.
The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration of the spells. If the action is completed before the spell's duration the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You may specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. </td></tr></tbody></table></span></p>
