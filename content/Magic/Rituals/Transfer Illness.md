description: The caster of this ritual may designate two creatures within 10 feet of each other and at least 20 feet from the caster; though the caster may desginate themselves as a source of destination creature for the illness. One creature must be designated the source, and the other the destination of the illness. If a participant is unwilling the caster must make a Resilience(End) save attack against that target to successfully conduct the ritual. Both targets must be creatures capable of receiving the illness (usually living creatures).<br><br>Once the ritual concludes any disease or poison effects current affecting the source creature are immediately transferred from the source, and are instead moved to the destination target. The duration of the effect continues where it was on the previous creature, along with any ability damage, drain, or status conditions that would be there as part of the illness; while all these effects are removed from the source.
