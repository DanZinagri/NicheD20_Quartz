essence_special: "In addition this talent allows you the ability to as a 3 AP action make an unattended Tiny flammable object within close range to catch on fire. This works as if you were using flint and steel except that you can use this talent in any sort of weather and it takes much less time to actually ignite an object.<br><br>Alternatively, once per day, as a 3 AP action you may create a small amount of light that follows you. You may create up to four lights that resemble lanterns or torches (and cast that amount of light). These lights last for 30 minutes plus an additional 30 minutes per 5 BCB. These must stay within a 10-foot-radius area in relation to each other but otherwise move as you desire (no concentration required): forward or back, up or down, straight or turning corners, or the like. The lights can move up to 100 feet per round. A light winks out if the distance between you and it exceeds medium range from you. You can only have one instance of this ability active at any one time. If you cast this spell while another casting is still in effect, the previous casting is dispelled. For every 3 BCB the maximum distance each light may be from each other improves by an additional 5 feet. You may spend a spell point to use this additional times per day beyond the limit."

anima_special: In addition this talent allows you the ability to as a 3 AP action to make a small localized area of cold for yourself. For 10 minutes per BCB you gain a +4 circumstance bonus against the effects of hot weather.<br><br>Additionally as a 4 AP action you can freeze a 5 foot surface, plus an additional 5 foot square per 3 BCB, of water or liquid with a similar freezing point to become a solid sheet of ice up to 3 feet thick. You may target a square within close range with this ability. Water frozen this way returns to its normal state after 1 round + 1 round per 2 BCB if the temperature would be one that would allow it to melt naturally; colder environments may allow the water to stay frozen longer or indefinitely. This ice may support the weight of a single creature at its maximum thickness as long as their is enough ice to cover all the creature's squares they occupy (medium needing only one square, while large needing four). Ice that its not anchored to a solid point (such as a shore) may simply drift or be carried by a current should the water move enough.
