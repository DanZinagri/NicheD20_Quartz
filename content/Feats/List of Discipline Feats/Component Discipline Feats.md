Component discipline feats are representative of the structure of magic, such as the somatic, runes, and implements that make up the parts of casting a spell. A character may only have one Component Discipline feat.

You may roll twice and take the better result when attempting to cast while bound or grappled. In addition you gain Armored Caster as a bonus feat even if you do not meet the prerequisites.<br></p></span></p><h3><span><p dir="auto">Unbound Implement (Component, Magic)</p></span></h3><p><span><p dir="auto"><b>Prerequisite</b>:    Casting<br></p></span></p><p><span><p dir="auto"><b>Benefit</b>:    Your implement may be wielded in different ways. You may use your implement without holding it as long as your implement is on your person (such as a ring, amulet, or earring); but the implement must not be stowed away in a backpack or other container. If a class feature would require the character to hold their implement (such as sword and tome style of Eldritch Knight), they may maintain the benefits of their implement as long as the implement is still on their person.<br></p></span></p>
