title: List of Stance Feats
---

Stance feats are a special type of combat feat, but have a special restriction. At the beginning of your turn you may, as a Reaction, adopt a single stance. A stance lasts until the end of a combat, or until you adopt a new stance, at which point your current stance immediately ends. Many feats use these stance feats as prerequisites but are not stance feats; if a feat has a stance feat as a prerequisite, that stance must be active to gain the benefits of that feat unless stated otherwise.
