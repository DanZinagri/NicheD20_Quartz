benefit: While in Blind Warrior Stance, when you miss a target because of concealment you may reroll your miss chance percentile roll; this stance does not allow you to reroll a second time if the result is still a miss.<br><br>An invisible attacker gets no advantages related to hitting you in melee; you don't lose your Agility bonus to AC, and the attacker doesn't get the usual +2 bonus for being invisible. An invisible attacker still receives bonuses for ranged attacks, and you are still considered Flat-Footed against those attacks. If you successfully pinpoint an invisible or hidden attacker, that attacker gets no advantages related to hitting you with ranged attacks. In addition, if you have the Blinded condition, you no longer need to make an Acrobatics check to move more than half your speed in a single movement.
