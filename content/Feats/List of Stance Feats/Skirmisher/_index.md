benefit: When in Skirmisher Stance, whenever a foe within your threatened area moves away from you, you may also Shift as a Reaction as long as this movement ends closer to the creature which moved away. If you take any movement other than a Shift during your next turn, treat your speed as 5 feet lower for each time you use this ability. If your speed on your next turn would be 0, you cannot use this ability.
