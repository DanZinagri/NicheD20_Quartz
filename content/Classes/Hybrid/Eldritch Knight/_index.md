# Class Features

The following are class features of the Eldritch Knight. 
## Weapon and Armor Proficiency

Eldritch Knights gain no additional proficiencies with any weapon or armor.
## Implements

An Eldritch knight gains no new implements, and utilizes any implements from existing casting classes.
## Casting

An eldritch knight may combine spells and talents to create magical effects, and uses her choice of Intelligence, Focus, or Psyche as her Casting Ability Modifier.
## Caster’s Concentration

As a spellcaster you gain a bonus rank in the concentration skill for every level of Eldritch Knight you possess.
## Mystic Pool

An eldritch knight learns to push their natural energies to create both the magical and extraordinary. This pool contains a number of points equal to her levels in eldritch knight. A mystic pool may be used as a stamina or a spell point pool, though it does not stack with either when determining the size of either pool. Similar to a stamina and spell point pool, a mystic pool restores itself after a long rest.

At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter the mystic pool’s size increases by an additional 1. If she obtains a mystic pool from another class or source she may combine the pools and their levels to determine the total capacity of the mystic pool.

Classes with a mystic pool count as both Martial and Casting classes for the purposes of determining MPB and SPB.
## Magic Talents

An eldritch knight gains 1 magic talent every odd level, each magic talent may be used to learn a new talent or new spell the eldritch knight qualifies for. In addition, she gains a bonus spell (but not talent) for every 3 levels she gains from this class.
## Eldritch Combat Style (Su)

At 1st level a eldritch knight selects a single eldritch combat style from the following list:
- **Sword and Tome Style**: The eldritch knight learned how to imbue her implement with additional martial prowess. When holding an implement in her off-hand she gains a +1 shield bonus to AC; any enhancement bonus the implement possesses she may also add to her AC as a shield bonus in addition to this shield bonus. The eldritch knight may make attacks with this implement (if it is not already a weapon), treating it as a light shield for the purposes of how much damage it deals. An eldritch knight is always considered proficient with her implement.
- **Implement Channeler**: The eldritch knight begins to channel through her implement as a weapon. The eldritch knight may treat her implement as a ranged weapon, capable of making ranged attacks dealing 1d6 bludgeoning damage with a x2 crit multiplier, and a 30 foot range increment. The implement always targets touch AC of the targets, and uses her casting ability modifier to hit with this weapon. The implement does not require ammunition but ceases to function as a ranged weapon if the eldritch knight's spell point pool and mystic pool are reduced to 0. Any enhancement bonuses the implement possesses are applied to the attack and damage rolls similar to an enchanted weapon. An eldritch knight is always considered proficient with her implement. This implement is treated as a one-handed ranged weapon unless it is an implement that must be wielded in two-hands (such as a quarterstaff).
- **Eldritch Blade**: The eldritch knight forms a closer bond with her weapon, treating it as an implement. This magical bond must be made with a masterwork quality weapon as a ritual that takes 1 hour and consumes exotic spell reagents costing 100 gp per SPB. If the Eldritch Knight is already using a weapon as an implement she may continue to use this weapon, rather than needing to perform this ritual again. Once bonded with a weapon the eldritch knight may add her casting ability modifier to saves against sunder and disarm attempts against this bonded weapon. Finally the eldritch knight may summon her blade from up to 30 feet away, or from any extradimensional space she controls (such as a bag of holding) to her hand as a reaction.
## Eldritch Knight Talents

At 2nd level the Eldritch Knight gains access to Eldritch Knight Talents when selecting class talents.

See [Eldritch Knight Talents](./Eldritch%20Knight%20Talents/_index.md) for a listing of Talents available for the Weapon Master class.
## Eldritch Jaunt (Ki)

An eldritch knight learns to use her arcane power to close the gap between her and her foes. At 3rd level an eldritch knight may spend 1 point from her mystic pool as a move action teleport a number of 5ft squares equal to her casting ability modifier. This teleport must bring her adjacent to an enemy she is capable of seeing.

If the eldritch knight possesses the lightspeed dash feat; when using this feat to make a charge action she may spend a mystic pool point in addition to the stamina point required by this feat to add 5ft per point of her casting ability modifier to the total movement allowed by the charge action.
## Eldritch Prowess

At 3rd level, and every 3 levels thereafter, the eldritch knight treats her SPB and MPB as 1 higher from her levels in eldritch knight, to a maximum equal to her hit dice.
## Mystic Conversion

At 4th level, Once per day, plus an additional time per day for every 2 levels of Eldritch Knight she possesses, the Eldritch Knight may convert one spell point or stamina point into a mystic pool point. The eldritch knight may use this ability as 4 AP action.
## Eldritch Parry (Ki)

At 5th level, an eldritch knight once per round may spend a reaction to make an attack roll in place of an AC roll or saving throw against a single hostile spell targeting her at a -3 penalty. If her attack roll result is greater than the attack roll or save attack of the spell, the spell is treated as if it had missed, or the eldritch knight mad a successful saving throw. If your attack roll succeeds by two degrees of success or more the spell is instead completely negated and dispelled.
## Invigorating Magic

At 6th level, when the Eldritch Knight casts a spell with himself as the target, or is one of the creatures affected by the spell, the Eldritch Knight gains a number of temporary hit points equal to his SPB. These temporary hit points do not stack with themselves, but last for 1 minute.
## Eldritch Strike

At 7th level an eldritch knight may make a single attack roll at her highest base attack bonus as a reaction after casting a spell. This may not be used with a spell modified by the spellstrike meta talent.
## Spell Shroud (Ki)

At 8th level, the Eldritch Knight may spend 1 Mystic Point as a 2 AP action, grant themselves a Miss Chance equal to their MPB (maximum 75%), and Spell Resistance equal to their SPB (maximum 75%). This effect lasts for 1 round. If the Eldritch Knight successfully uses their Eldritch Parry ability they may instead use this ability as a reaction.
## Mighty Magic

At 9th level, whenever an eldritch knight casts a spell she may add half her Strength modifier to the save attack roll of the spell. If the eldritch knight possesses weapon finesse or some other ability that allows her to use Agility or Endurance in place of Strength on attack rolls she may use that instead of Strength for this ability. In addition, any feat or class feature that calls for a save attack that relies on Strength, Agility, or Endurance; the Eldritch Knight may add half of her casting ability ability modifier to the save attack of these abilities.

This ability only functions while the eldritch knight has 1 or more points in her mystic pool, spell pool, and stamina pool.
## Eldritch Might

At 10th level, the eldritch knight learns to pour her martial power into her magic and let her magic push her might to further limits. A number of times per day equal to her levels in eldritch knight plus her casting ability modifier, when casting a spell she may use her BAB in place of her BCB for the purposes of determining the power of the spell she is attempting to cast, or may use her BCB in place of her BAB for the purposes of making an attack roll (if it would be beneficial). If the Eldritch Knight's BAB and BCB are equal she may instead use this ability to grant herself a +2 bonus to BAB or BCB for the purpose of the spell or attack roll instead.
