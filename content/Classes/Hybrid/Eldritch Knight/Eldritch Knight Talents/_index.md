| Eldritch Riposte                 | Eldritch Parry                                 | Once per round if the eldritch knight’s result is two degrees of success higher than the attack roll or save attack of the spell, she may spend a mystic pool point as a reaction to instead cause the original caster to be affected by the spell as if it was cast upon them.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Elemental Arrow                  | Force Arrow, Eldritch Knight 4th               | As a reaction the Eldritch Knight may cause her force arrows to instead be converted to an elemental type matching one of her known or prepared affinity talents. When converting her arrows she deals an additional 1d6 damage of the chosen element’s type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Force Arrow                      | Eldritch Blade combat style                    | If the eldritch knight selected a ranged projectile weapon as her implement she no longer needs to supply it with ammunition as the weapon forms ammunition of pure force. The weapon must still be reloaded as normal, with the action of reloading causing the ammunition to form in the weapon. In addition these force arrows cause the weapon to deal damage as if it was one size category larger; but otherwise deal damage of the same type as the weapon normally would. |
| Greater Jaunt                    | Eldritch Jaunt, Eldritch Knight 6th            | The Eldritch Knight increases the distance she is able to teleport using their Eldritch Jaunt by 10 feet. The Eldritch Knight may increase the Mystic Pool cost by 1 to double the distance normally allowed for the Eldritch Jaunt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Implement Barrage                | Implement Channeler style, Two-Weapon Fighting | If the eldritch knight is wielding an implement in each hand she may treat them as light weapons for the purposes of two-weapon fighting penalties. In addition when making attacks with an implement in her main and off-hand as part of a focused attack she may make a bonus attack at her highest base attack bonus -5.                                                                                                                                                       |
| Implement Kata                   | Implement Channeler style                      | If your implement is also a melee weapon, when you successfully strike a foe in melee with your implement, you may make a bonus attack with the implement channeler ability at your highest base attack bonus -5 as a reaction once per round.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Reactive Jaunt                   | Eldritch Jaunt, Eldritch Knight 3rd            | The Eldritch Knight may increase the Mystic Pool cost by 1 to use her Eldritch Jaunt as a reaction when a creature makes an attack roll against them, teleporting to a space adjacent to the attacking creature, only if the attacking creature would be within range of their Eldritch Jaunt. The Eldritch Knight gains a dodge bonus equal to her CAM against the triggering attack.                                                                                            |
| Scroll Strike                    | Eldritch Strike, Eldrtich Knight 7th           | The Eldritch Knight may use his Eldritch Strike ability in conjunction with a spell cast from an item such as a scroll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Unbreakable Implement            | Eldritch Knight 2nd                            | The Eldritch Knight increases the Hardness of his wielded implement by 1, +1 per 5 Eldritch Knight levels. In addition he may once per day, as 1 AP action, add his SPB in Eldritch Knight as a number of temporary hit to his Implement; these temporary hit points last 24 hours, and cannot stack with themselves.                                                                                                                                                             |
