Hybrid classes are classes with both access to martial and magic capabilities, usually at a slight reduction in the efficiency in both while gaining the power and flexibility of combining the two. For more information on [Martial](/Classes/Martial) and [Magic](/Classes/Magic) see their individual pages for more information.
