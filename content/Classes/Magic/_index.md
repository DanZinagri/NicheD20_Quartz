## Spell Prowess Bonus

Spell Prowess Bonus (SPB) is a representation of one level in casting classes. Similar to Martial Prowess Bonus (MPB) this helps determine a portion of the scaling on spells and abilities between classes. This is usually used to determine what the foe must roll against for saves; meaning as long as one continues taking levels in casting classes their spells may remain the appropriate power for the level theyâ€™re at.
