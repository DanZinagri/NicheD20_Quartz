| Unmoving            | Armor Master 4th                | Select one maneuver (except sunder). Whether using his armor as leverage against a grappling foe or using its weight to help him stop a trip, a Armor Master can use his armor to protect him from the chosen combat maneuver. While wearing armor or wielding a shield, the Armor Master gains a bonus to his saves against the chosen combat maneuver. The bonus is +1 if he’s wearing light armor and +2 if he’s wearing heavy armor. This bonus increases by 2 at 10th level. This talent may be selected more than once, each time selecting a new maneuver. |
