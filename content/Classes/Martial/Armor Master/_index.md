# Class Features

This pool contains a number of stamina points equal to his Endurance modifier plus levels in martial classes (minimum 1). This pool replenishes once per day after a long rest.

## Martial Training

## Armor Specialization

At 3rd level, the Armor Master selects light or heavy armor. While wearing the selected type of armor the Armor Master treats the armor’s hit points as a number of points higher equal to twice his Armor Master level if wearing light armor, or four times his Armor Master level if wearing heavy. This adjustment to hit points only is in effect while the fighter is wearing the armor and simply adjusts the current and maximum hit points of the armor when the armor is donned or removed. At 8th level the fighter now ignores the broken condition of his armor.

## Greater Armor Sacrifice
