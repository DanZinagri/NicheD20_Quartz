# Class Features

The following are class features of the Frenzied Berserker. 
## Weapon and Armor Proficiency

Frenzied Berserker gain no additional proficiencies with any weapon or armor.
## Stamina

At 1st level, a Frenzied Berserker gains access to a pool of <a href="/Rules/Combat%20Rules/Combat%20Statistics#stamina">stamina</a> points that allow him to perform feats of strength and agility. This pool contains a number of stamina points equal to his Endurance modifier plus levels in martial classes (minimum 1). This pool replenishes once per day after a long rest.
## Berserker

At 1st level, The Frenzied Berserker learns to throw caution to the wind, choosing to explore the depths of your rage. While raging and in power stance you gain an additional +1 to damage for every -1 penalty you take on your attack rolls with power stance (this is added to the damage of power stance before it is increased by an additional 50% for a weapon in 2h or a 1-1/2x Str damage weapon)

In addition, he may treat his levels in Frenzied Berserker as Barbarian levels for the purposes of determining the bonuses and effects of your Barbarian Rage class feature.
## Berserker's Vitality

At 1st level, the Frenzied Berserker may treat their levels in Frenzied Berserker as Barbarian levels for the purposes of determining the bonuses and effects of their Barbaric Vitality class feature.
## Frenzied Berserker Talents

At 2nd level the Frenzied Berserker gains access to Frenzied Berserker Talents when selecting class talents.

See [Frenzied Berserker Talents](./Frenzied%20Berserker%20Talents/_index.md) for a listing of Talents available for the Frenzied Berserker class.
## Haunted (Ki)

At 2nd level, the souls of the slain and dead surround the Frenzied Berserker, as the moans of his victims follow him. The penalties from the shaken condition from foes the Frenzied Berserker has successfully used demoralize on are doubled, and the Frenzied Berserker gains a bonus to intimidate checks made to demoralize equal to his bonus to attack rolls from his rage. Creatures adjacent to the Frenzied Berserker take a -2 penalty to saves against fear effects originating from the Frenzied Berserker.
## Overwhelming Might

At 3rd level, when raging you add an additional 50% of your strength modifier on damage rolls (for example a 1h weapon would add 1.5x strength modifier while a 2h weapon would add 2x now); this does not apply if the weapon did not already add an ability modifier to its damage rolls.  In addition the damage bonus from rage is increased by half (+50%) if you are making an attack with a melee weapon using two hands, or a weapon that adds 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier or more on damage rolls.
## Aggression

At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter the Frenzied Berserker gains access to additional Aggressions, as the Barbarian class feature of the same name. These Aggressions can be selected from both those available to the Barbarian, as well as those only available to the Frenzied Berserker. The Frenzied Berserker treats his levels as Barbarian levels for the purposes of meeting the prerequisites of any Aggression.

See [Frenzied Berserker Aggressions](./Frenzied%20Berserker%20Aggressions.md) for a listing of Aggression available to the Frenzied Berserker.
## Frenzied Vigor

At 4th level the Frenzied Berserker may use the Barbarian's Vigor class feature an additional time per day.
## Frenzy

At 5th level, you have learned to take your rage even further beyond. Once per day when entering a rage you may instead enter a frenzy. Frenzy grants the same effects as rage and is treated as a rage for all effects that require rage. When in a frenzy you gain an additional +4 bonus to attack and damage rolls, and gain 1 additional AP each round. You take an additional -2 penalty to AC in addition to the normal effects of rage, and take 2 points of nonlethal damage for each round you remain in frenzy. This nonlethal damage automatically bypasses any DR, Temporary Hit points, or even Immunities the Frenzied Berserker might possess. While in a frenzy their fury pool's maximum capacity doubled.

If you wish to end the frenzy early you must make a Mental save (against 12 + ½ your MPB) once per round as a free action, success ends the frenzy immediately and you are fatigued for 1 minute (this bypasses any immunities to fatigue).

During a frenzy the Frenzied Berserker must attack those he perceives as foes to the best of his ability. Should he run out of enemies before the frenzy expires, the rampage continues, attacking the nearest creature (determined randomly if several creatures are equal distance), and will fight that creature regardless.
## Frenzied Speed

At 6th level the Frenzied Berserker's speed improves by 10 feet while in a Frenzy. This effect applies to all movement modes the Frenzied Berserker possesses (such as a Fly, Climb or Swim speed).
## Vengeful Spirits (Ki)

At 7th level, the malevolent spirits surrounding the Frenzied Berserker now claw out at those around him, adding the energies of the dead to his assaults. The Frenzied Berserker’s melee attacks deal additional decay damage equal to his Psyche modifier (minimum 1); . Creatures who start their turn adjacent to the Frenzied Berserker while he is raging are subject to an intimidate check from the Frenzied Berserker as if he attempted to demoralize them.
## Frightful Charge

At 8th level, the Frenzied Berserker becomes a terrifying force when charging towards his enemies. When the Frenzied Berserker uses the Charge action while in a Frenzy creatures adjacent to the barbarian's path while charging, and the creature at the end of the charge are subject to a intimidate check to demoralize them. In addition creatures the Frenzied Berserker successfully demoralizes during this charge are unable to make attacks of opportunity against the Berserker for moving through threatened squares during this charge.
## Sated Bloodlust

At 9th level, the Frenzied Berserker learns to sate his bloodlust to more easily quell his frenzy. For each creature slain while in a Frenzy the Frenzied Berserker reduces the Mental save required to end the Frenzy by 2 to a minimum of a DC 10.
## Storm of Souls (Ki)

At 10th level, the Frenzied Berserker learns to temporarily disperse the souls that cling to him, sending their malevolent energies out. By spending 1 stamina as a 4 AP action all foes within 30 feet of the Frenzied Berserker are subject to a Resilience(Psy) save attack (against 1d20 + ½ your MPB + his Psyche modifier). The Frenzied Berserker May add his weapon's enhancement bonus to this save attack. Successful save attack deals 1d6 points of decay energy damage per two levels of Frenzied Berserker he possesses and are treated as if the Frenzied Berserker had successfully demoralized them with an intimidate check. A failed save attack reduces the damage by half. Success by two degrees or more increases the effect of the demoralize by one step (from shaken to frightened, and frightened to panicked or cowering). 

If the Frenzied Berserker hits a creature already under the effects of a fear effect he immediately heals for 2 hit points, plus an additional 2 hit points per degree of success on the save attack; this can trigger for each enemy if multiple enemies hit with 
this ability.

The Frenzied Berserker must wait 1d4 rounds between uses of this ability. In addition, the Frenzied Berserker may spend 2 fury to reduce the AP cost of this action by 1.
