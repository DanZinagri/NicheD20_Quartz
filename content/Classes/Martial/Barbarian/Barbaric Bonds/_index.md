| Animal Aspect (Ki) | The barbarian forms a bond with nature becoming more bestial in form. While raging the barbarian’s penalty to AC increases by an additional 2, but also gains a +1 bonus to natural armor (or increases his existing bonus to natural armor by 1). In addition he gains an additional +2 bonus to Strength and Agility while raging. At 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter this natural armor improves by an additional 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Death Bond         | The barbarian becomes more powerful the more danger he is in and the closer to death he becomes. When the barbarian is reduced below half health while raging he may activate this ability as a free action, even if it is not his turn. While active this ability grants the barbarian an additional +1 bonus to hit and +2 bonus to damage rolls; but he no longer gains his usual temporary hit points per round when raging. When the barbarian is reduced below one quarter his maximum health this bonus improves to +2 bonus to hit and +4 bonus to damage rolls. If the barbarian is reduced to 0 hit points or lower this bonus improves to +3 bonus to hit and +6 bonus to damage rolls, and gains DR 1/- (this stacks with other untyped DR the barbarian possesses), as long as the barbarian would be capable of acting while at 0 or lower. This DR improves by an additional 1 at 10th. In addition at 10th level, nonlethal damage in excess of his maximum nonlethal only converts half of the excess damage into lethal damage rather than the full amount while using this ability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Mounted Fury       | The barbarian gains the service of a mount. It gains a companion as described on the companion page treating your levels in barbarian -3 as your SPB to determine the progression of this companion (and stacks with SPB gained from other sources for determining the progression of this companion). The animal companion gained this way must select the Beast or Serpentine form. It gains the animal type as its companion type. In addition the animal companion automatically starts as Large sized; and gains Mount companion talent. The companion gains these types and talents even if the barbarian does not meet the prerequisites. While companions can take many forms a barbarian’s animal companion should usually have a form similar to that of a beast (wolf, tiger, boar, horse, etc..) though the GM may allow for other creatures. If a barbarian releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 16 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. In addition, when entering a rage, and mounted or adjacent to your mount, you may spend 1 additional stamina to grant the benefits of your rage to your mount. The mount does not gain the benefits of any other features you possess that grant additional effects while raging. This ability counts as the animal companion class feature for the purposes of meeting prerequisites. |
| Tribal Bond        | The barbarian becomes a strong leading figure and learns to inspire his allies with his courage. While raging, all allies within 30 feet of the barbarian (excluding the barbarian himself) gain a +1 morale bonus on attack, MSB, and damage rolls. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter this morale bonus improves by an additional 1. In addition, while raging the barbarian may spend 1 fury as a 1 AP action to grant all allies affected by this ability temporary hit points equal to the temporary hit points granted by his rage ability until the start of your next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
