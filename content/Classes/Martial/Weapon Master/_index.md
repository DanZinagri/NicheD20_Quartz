This pool contains a number of stamina points equal to his Endurance modifier plus levels in martial classes (minimum 1). This pool replenishes once per day after a long rest.
## Improved Weapon Training

At 1st level, the Weapon Master may add his Weapon Master levels to his Fighter levels for the purposes of determining the bonuses from his Weapon Training class feature. In addition, the bonus to damage from Weapon Training may now be multiplied on a critical hit.
## Improved Fighter's Flexibility

At 1st level, the Weapon Master may add his weapon Master level to his Fighter levels for the purposes of determining the bonuses and effects from his Fighter’s Flexibility class feature.

In addition, while benefitting from his Fighter's Flexibility the Weapon Master may utilize his weapon to deal Bludgeoning, Slashing, or Piercing damage regardless of the weapon's normal damage type. The type of damage must be chosen before the attack is made. The fighter may spend 1 Stamina as a reaction to cause all attacks made with a weapon to be treated as all 3 physical damage types at the same time until the start of their next turn.
## Weapon Master Talents

At 2nd level the Weapon Master gains access to Weapon Master Talents when selecting class talents.

See [Weapon Master Talents](./Weapon%20Master%20Talents/_index.md) for a listing of Talents available for the Weapon Master class.
## Martial Training

At 2nd level and at every even level thereafter, a Weapon Master gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as Combat Feats or Martial feats.
## Master's Initiative

At 3th level, the Weapon Master adds his Weapon Training bonus to his initiative in combat. If the Weapon Master possesses the Quick Draw feat he may also draw a weapon as part of rolling initiative if the weapon possesses one of the selected keywords of his weapon training.

The Weapon Master may spend 1 Stamina as a reaction as part of rolling initiative to instead roll his initiative twice and take either result he chooses. 
## Weapon Versatility

At 5th level, the Weapon Master broadens his understanding to all weaponry. The Weapon Master may now gain the benefits of his Weapon Training class feature with all keywords available to this feature in addition to those he had previously chosen.

In addition, the Weapon Master may spend 1 Stamina as a 1 AP action to double the bonus to damage from his weapon training feature for 1 minute.
## Master's Improvisation

At 7th level, the Weapon Master learns to turn everyday objects into deadly implements. The weapon master treats any wielded improvised weapon as having a keyword most closely matching the object, such as a broken bottle being treated as a light blade, or a barstool as a hammer. The improvised weapon gains the benefits of the fighter's weapon training if this keyword matches his weapon training keyword. In addition the fighter may use objects that would normally be considered unfit as an improvised weapon, such as a writing quill, or a fish. The fighter still treats weapons utilized in this way as improvised weapons for the purposes of determining any penalties or benefits from wielding them.

In addition, the Weapon Master now ignores the penalties of the broken condition on any weapon they wield; though weapons at 0 hit points are still destroyed and unable to be wielded as normal. If a weapon the Weapon Master is wielding would be reduced below 1 hit point the Weapon Master may spend 1 Stamina as a reaction to set the weapon's hit points to 1 and prevent the weapon from being destroyed. The Weapon Master may only prevent a weapon from being destroyed in this way once, until the weapon has received any repairs to bring it above 1 hit point.
## Damage Type Mastery

At 9th level, the Weapon Master is able to utilize different damage types to great effect. If the weapon is dealing Bludgeoning, Slashing, or Piercing damage the weapon may have an additional effect when dealing damage of that type. These effects only work when wielding a weapon matching one of your weapon training keywords. If an effect calls for a save attack the save attack is made at 1d20 + Base Attack Bonus + Strength or Agility modifier (whichever is higher) unless specified otherwise. This may add the enhancement bonus of a wielded weapon to this save attack.

You may only select one of the following effects to apply when dealing damage of the matching type:
- Rattling Strike (Bludgeoning): When dealing bludgeoning damage the weapon master may spend one stamina to make a Resilience(End) save attack against the foe. A successful save attack causes the creature to become staggered for 1 round, increasing by an additional round per degree of success of the save attack.
- Destructive Blow (Bludgeoning): The Weapon Master may double his Weapon Training bonus to damage for the purposes of calculating the damage dealt to objects and sunder maneuvers.
- Bypass Armor (Piercing): When dealing piercing damage the weapon master may spend one stamina to deny the target the ability to use their Armor Redirection and Armor Sacrifice ability against the attack.
- Devastating Thrust (Piercing): When dealing piercing damage with a weapon, the Weapon Master gain a +1 bonus to damage rolls for all piercing weapon damage made until the start of the Weapon Master's next turn. This effect only occurs after damage has been dealt and is applied to further attacks made in the turn, in addition this bonus may stack with itself.
- Jugular Slice (Slashing): When you make a critical hit with slashing damage the Weapon Master causes additional bleed damage equal to the weapon's damage dice. This bleed lasts for 1 minute per Weapon Master level and treats the Weapon Master's BAB as 5 points higher for the purposes of determining the difficulty to remove this bleed.
- Bloodied Sight (Slashing): When dealing slashing damage with a weapon, the Weapon master may spend 1 Stamina to make a Phsycial(Agi) save attack against the target. A successful save attack causes the foe to take 1 point of bleed damage and the foe gains the blinded condition until the bleed is successfully removed. For each degree of success treat the Weapon Master's BAB as 1 higher for the purposes of determining the difficulty to remove this bleed effect.

Should the Weapon Master spend the stamina to cause the weapon to count as all 3 damage types at once, the Weapon Master may spend an additional stamina to apply one bonus of each damage type from the above list.
## Weapon Mastery

At 10th level, a Weapon Master learns to break the limits of the weapons and pull out the latent potential. The Weapon Master may train with a weapon they possess for 8 hours. When using the trained weapon the weapon's damage dice is improved by 1 step, has their damage multiplier increased by 1 (×2 becomes ×3, for example). In addition the critical threat range of the weapon improves by 1 and the bonuses granted by weapon training increase by 2 with the selected weapon. This effect last until the Weapon Master spends 8 hours training with a weapon, gaining the benefits with that weapon instead.

In Addition, the Weapon Master may imbue their trained weapon with a portion of their vitality. As a 2 AP action that costs 1 Stamina; the Weapon Master causes all attacks with their weapon to bypass half of any DR or Hardness a creature or object may possess for 1 minute.
