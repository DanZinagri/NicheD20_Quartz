This pool contains a number of stamina points equal to his Endurance modifier plus levels in martial classes (minimum 1). This pool replenishes once per day after a long rest.
## Improved Weapon Training

At 1st level, the Weapon Master increases the bonuses from his Fighter Weapon training class feature. In addition he may add his Weapon Master levels to his Fighter levels for the purposes of determining the bonuses from his Weapon Training class feature.
## Improved Fighter's Flexibility

At 1st level, the Weapon Master may add his weapon Master level to his Fighter levels for the purposes of determining the onuses from his Fighter’s Flexibility class feature.
## Weapon Master Talents

At 2nd level the Weapon Master gains access to Weapon Master Talents when selecting class talents.

See [Weapon Master Talents](./Weapon%20Master%20Talents/_index.md) for a listing of Talents available for the Weapon Master class.
## Martial Training

At 2nd level and at every even level thereafter, a Weapon Master gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as Combat Feats or Martial feats.
## Weapon Specialization

At 3rd level, pick a single weapon keyword you have chosen with your weapon training class feature. You gain an additional +2 damage with weapons with that keyword; this damage is increased by effects that increase your strength modifier on damage rolls (such as the 1.5x strength modifier damage when wielding a two-handed weapon).
## Master's Initiative

At 5th level, the Weapon Master adds his weapon training bonus to his initiative in combat. If the Weapon Master possesses the Quick Draw feat he may also draw a weapon as part of rolling initiative if the weapon possesses one of the keywords of his weapon training.
## Master's Improvisation

At 7th level, the Weapon Master becomes a master of not only getting the maximum utility out of his weapon, but also learns to turn anything into a deadly implement. The Weapon Master may utilize his weapon to deal Bludgeoning, Slashing, or Piercing damage regardless of the weapon's normal damage type. The type of damage must be chosen before the attack is made.

In addition, the Weapon Master can turn everyday objects into deadly implements. The weapon master treats any wielded improvised weapon as having a keyword most closely matching the object, such as a broken bottle being treated as a light blade, or a barstool as a hammer. The improvised weapon gains the benefits of the fighter's weapon training if this keyword matches his weapon training keyword. In addition the fighter may use objects that would normally be considered unfit as an improvised weapon, such as a writing quill, or a fish.
## Damage Type Mastery

At 9th level, the Weapon Master is able to utilize different damage types to great effect. If the weapon is dealing Bludgeoning, Slashing, or Piercing damage the weapon may have an additional effect when dealing damage of that type. These effects only work when wielding a weapon matching one of your weapon training keywords. If an effect calls for a save attack the save attack is made at 1d20 + Base Attack Bonus + Strength or Agility modifier (whichever is higher) unless specified otherwise. This may add the enhancement bonus of a wielded weapon to this save attack.

You may only select one of the following effects to apply when dealing damage of the matching type:
- Rattling Strike (Bludgeoning): When dealing bludgeoning damage the weapon master may spend one stamina to make a Resilience(End) save attack against the foe. A successful save attack causes the creature to become staggered for 1 round, increasing by an additional round per degree of success of the save attack.
- Destructive Blow (Bludgeoning): The Weapon Master may double his Weapon Training bonus to damage for the purposes of calculating the damage dealt to objects and sunder maneuvers.
- Bypass Armor (Piercing): When dealing piercing damage the weapon master may spend one stamina to deny the target the ability to use their Armor Redirection and Armor Sacrifice ability against the attack.
- Devastating Thrust (Piercing): When dealing piercing damage with a weapon, the Weapon Master gain a +1 bonus to damage rolls for all piercing weapon damage made until the start of the Weapon Master's next turn. This effect only occurs after damage has been dealt and is applied to further attacks made in the turn, in addition this bonus may stack with itself.
- Jugular Slice (Slashing): When you make a critical hit with slashing damage the Weapon Master causes additional bleed damage equal to the weapon's damage dice. This bleed lasts for 1 minute per Weapon Master level and treats the Weapon Master's BAB as 5 points higher for the purposes of determining the difficulty to remove this bleed.
- Bloodied Sight (Slashing): When dealing slashing damage with a weapon, the Weapon master may spend 1 Stamina to make a Phsycial(Agi) save attack against the target. A successful save attack causes the foe to take 1 point of bleed damage and the foe gains the blinded condition until the bleed is successfully removed. For each degree of success treat the Weapon Master's BAB as 1 higher for the purposes of determining the difficulty to remove this bleed effect.
## Weapon Mastery

At 10th level, a Weapon Master chooses one weapon that is part of one of his selected weapon training keyword, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. The selected weapon deals damage as if the fighter was one size category larger, have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (×2 becomes ×3, for example). In addition the critical threat range of the weapon improves by 1 and the bonuses granted by weapon training increase by 2 with the selected weapon.
