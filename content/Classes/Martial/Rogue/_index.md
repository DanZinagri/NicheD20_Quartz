# Class Features

The following are class features of the rogue.

## Weapon and Armor Proficiency

A rogue is proficient with all simple weapons and armor. If this is the character’s first level in a class he gains proficiency in all light martial armor and any martial weapon with the light keyword.

## Stamina (Ex)

At 1st level, a rogue gains access to a pool of <a href="/Rules/Combat%20Rules/Combat%20Statistics/#stamina">stamina</a> points that allows her to perform feats of strength and agility. This pool contains a number of stamina points equal to his Endurance modifier plus her levels in martial classes (minimum 1). This pool replenishes once per day after a long rest.

## Rogue’s Footing (Ex)

If this is the character’s first level in a martial class, the rogue gains Duelist Stance and Precision Stance as a bonus feat, even if she would not meet the prerequisites.
## Rogue’s Niche (Ex)

At 1st level the rogue may pick two niches that define type of rogue she wishes to be, gaining various the listed benefits. Each niche has an associated skill, the rogue treats their ranks in the associated skill as 5 higher for the purposes of qualifying for feats, or determining the effects of feats that rely on the ranks of the associated skill; this stacks with other abilities that would allow the rogue to treat their skill as possessing additional ranks, such as the Skill Focus feat.

## Rogue’s Insight (Ex)

A rogue knows the importance of where to strike. At 1st level as a 2 AP action the rogue may study a single enemy she can see. Upon doing so she gains a +1 insight bonus to attack and damage rolls against the studied creature. This effect lasts until that opponent is dead or the rogue studies a new target. This bonus to damage is precision damage. The rogue may spend 1 stamina to use this ability as a reaction. A rogue may only have one target studied in this way at a time, and studying a new target ends this effect immediately. This bonus improves by +1 at 4th level and every 3 thereafter.
## Rogue Talents (Ex)

A rogue gains access to new abilities that may aid and alter her in combat called Rogue Talents. At 2nd level the Rogue gains access to Rogue Talents when selecting class talents.

For a complete listing of Rogue talents see [List of Rogue Talents](./List%20of%20Rogue%20Talents.md)
## Nose For Danger (Ex)

At 2nd level, a rogue gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light or no armor, improving by an additional 1 every 4 rogue levels after 2nd. In addition the rogue is no longer flat-footed if she has not acted yet in combat. At 8th level, a rogue becomes immune to the flanked condition when attacked by creatures less than 4 hit dice higher than the rogue's hit dice.
## Evasion (Ex)

At 3rd level, a rogue gains the Evasion (Martial) feat as a bonus feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites.
## Sneak Attack (Ex)

A rogue learns to strike at a vital spot to deal extra damage when her foe is unable to properly defend themselves. At 3rd level, when making a Focused Attack, or an additional attack as part of a focused attack, against a target that is either flanked by her or is flat-footed, she is capable of dealing extra damage known as a sneak attack. This extra damage is 1d6 at 3rd level, and increases by 1d6 every 5 levels of rogue she possesses. Ranged attacks can be sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet + an additional 5 feet per two rogue levels she possesses. Additional damage from a sneak attack is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. The rogue may spend 1 stamina to increase this damage to 1d6 precision damage for every 2 levels of rogue she possesses until the start of her next turn.

With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap or unarmed strike), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals only lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack—not even with the usual –4 penalty.

A rogue may also force a sneak attack upon a foe she has studied with Rogue’s Insight to carefully find their weak spot. After successfully hitting a rogue may as a free action deal sneak attack damage to that foe even if they wouldn’t normally be subject to a sneak attack. Doing so immediately ends her Rogue’s Insight against that target.

A sneak attack may only be utilized with light melee, ranged, or thrown weapon. Other abilities may modify what a sneak attack may be utilized with.
## Skillful

At 4th level, and 8th level, the Rogue gains a bonus Skill feat of their choice that they qualify for.
## Improved Niche

At 5th and 7th level, the Rogue gains access to a more powerful specialization known as a Improved Niche; expanding upon their Rogue Niches chosen at 1st level. You may select an additional Rouge's Niche instead of selecting an Improved Niche.

For a complete listing of Improved Niches see [List of Improved Niches](./List%20of%20Improved%20Niches.md)
## Skill Mastery

At 6th level, the rogue becomes so confident in the use of certain skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions. Upon gaining this ability, she selects a number of skills equal to her Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). When making a skill check with one of these skills, she may take 10 even if normally unable to do so.
## Light Steps

At 7th level, by spending 1 stamina as a 4 AP action the rogue may move up to twice her speed, ignoring difficult terrain. While using this ability she may run across any surface; allowing the rogue to move across water, lava, or even the thinnest tree branches. The rogue must end her move on a surface that can support her normally or immediately fall. She cannot move across air in this way, nor can she walk up walls or other vertical surfaces, unless she has some other ability that would allow her to do so. When moving in this way, she does not take damage from surfaces or hazards that react to being touched, such as lava, caltrops, or traps with pressure plates; nor does she need to make Acrobatics checks to avoid falling on slippery or rough surfaces.
## Stalker

At 8th level, the rogue may add half her levels in rogue against the target of her Rogue’s Insight for Disguise, Intimidate, and Stealth checks made against that creature. In addition, when the Rogue reduces the target of her Rogue's Insight to 0 or fewer hit points she may use her Rogue's insight on an additional target as a reaction.
## Mobile Combatant

At 9th level, when the Rogue moves 10 feet or more in a round the rogue gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC. In addition if the rogue makes this movement before attacking she treats any weapon wielded as if it was one size category larger for the purposes of determining the damage it would deal for the next attack made before the start of her next turn.
## Perfect Dodge

At 10th level, the rogue learns to push her reflexes beyond their usual limits to avoid an attack. As a reaction the rogue can spend 2 stamina to cause a melee or ranged attack roll or combat maneuver to automatically miss. If the attack rolls a natural 20 the attack still hits you but is not a critical. The rogue may use this ability after the attack has been rolled and the results revealed, but doing so increases the stamina cost by 2. The rogue cannot use this ability again without first taking a short rest between uses.
