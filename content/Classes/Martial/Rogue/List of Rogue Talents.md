This talent may be used with other talents with sneak attack as a prerequisite.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Bewildering Attack      | Sneak Attack              | Whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a creature they take a –1 penalty to AC.

| Dark Adaptation         | \-                        | The rogue gains blindsense out to a range of 5 feet, but only against creatures concealed by darkness or her own blindness. She still suffers the normal miss chance for attacking creatures with concealment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Deft Palm               | \-                        | A rogue with this talent may use sleight of hand to conceal a weapon while holding it in plain sight, even while being observed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Disorienting Attack     | Sneak Attack              | Whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a creature they take a –1 penalty on attack rolls. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the penalty on attack rolls increases by an additional –1. This effect lasts for 1 round, and additional applications do not stack, but increase the duration by 1 round.                                                                                                                                                    |

If your check is higher the effect is dispelled and immediately ends.                                                                                     |

Also, when the rogue deliberately falls, a DC 15 Acrobatics check allows her to ignore the first 20 feet fallen, instead of the first 10 feet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Fast Stealth            | \-                        | The rogue reduces the penalties for moving at full speed while using stealth by half. If the rogue has another ability that reduces these abilities by half she instead takes no penalty for moving at full speed while stealthing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Heads Up                | \-                        | When you make a Perception check, as a reaction you can allow one adjacent ally to act as if they had also made a Perception check with the same result.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
