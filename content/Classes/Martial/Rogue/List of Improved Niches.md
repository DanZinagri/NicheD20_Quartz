| Acrobatic Stunt  | Acrobat Niche      | The rogue treats her movement speed as 5 feet faster for every 5 ranks of Arcobatics she possesses (minimum 5 feet), for the purposes of determining the maximum distance she may move when making a check to jump. 

In addition the rogue’s quick reflexes has given them additional benefits, granting it a +2 bonus to initiative and Physical saving throws as long as she has 1 point of stamina remaining.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Brute            | Hired Muscle Niche | The rogue has learned how to get results cracking knees, limbs, and skulls. When dealing damage against the target of her Rogue's Insight that is also under a fear effect the Rogue improves the damage bonus of her Rogue's Insight by an additional 1 per 10 ranks in Intimidate she possesses (minimum 1). When dealing nonlethal damage with this the rogue may also increase the duration of the fear effect by an additional round each time they successfully strike the target; to a maximum of double the normal duration of the fear effect.
In addition as long as the rogue has at least 1 stamina remaining any time she would successfully intimidate a foe already under the effects of a fear effect must, instead of gaining the usual effects of an intimidate, must instead roll twice and take the worse result on their next d20 roll before the end of their next turn. This effect may be applied multiple times to a target, applying to a different roll the target makes each time, up to a maximum number of times in a round equal to the rogue's Psyche modifier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Fencer           | Duelist Niche      | You’ve furthered your artform in dueling and now can more deftly dodge foes. 

When wielding a weapon with the dueling keyword, as long as the rogue has 1 stamina remaining, the rogue gains half her bonus to attack rolls from Rogue’s Insight as a dodge bonus to AC against the target of her Rogue’s Insight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Shadow           | Burglar Niche      | The rogue has become adept at avoiding danger granting her an additional 1% miss chance for every two rogue levels she possesses when affected by concealment or total concealment effects.
In addition, while the rogue has at least 1 point of stamina remaining she gains the benefits of concealment until the start of her next turn. If within areas of dim light or darkness this is instead  total concealment; if the creature targeting the rogue would be able to see normally within dim light or darkness they instead treat this as concealment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Thief            | Pickpocket Niche   | You’ve learned to include your thievery into your everyday life. The rogue becomes more adept at performing disarm and dirty trick maneuvers. As long as the rogue has at least 1 stamina remaining the rogue may move up to half her speed as a reaction after successfully performing a dirty trick or disarm combat maneuver; this movement doesn’t provoke from the creature you had performed the dirty trick or disarm maneuver against.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Tomb Raider      | Dungeoneer Niche   | The rogue has learned to both act more carefully around the traps and hazards in dungeons, but also act more deftly should one be triggered. The rogue doubles the dodge bonus from her bonus from her Nose For Danger class feature against traps and may also apply this bonus to any saving throws from any traps or hazards encountered. This does not apply against effects originating from creatures unless it would leave a lingering hazard that would require a save, such spikes or a pit of acid.

In addition the rogue has learned to roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it than she otherwise would. The rogue may spend 1 stamina when she would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the rogue can attempt to roll with the damage. To use this ability, the rogue must attempt a Physical(Agi) saving throw against a DC of 10 + the amount of hit points the attack would have reduced you below 0. If the save succeeds, she takes only half damage from the attack; if it fails, she takes damage as normal. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute her defensive roll, and if she is Flat-Footed she can’t use this ability. The rogue’s evasion ability does not apply to this ability. |
| Venom Master(Ki) | Poisoner Niche     | The rogue has become adept at the use of poison. The rogue has now learned to put a bit of her very essence into the poisons she creates. Once per day the rogue may enhance a single dose of poison causing it to become more difficult to resist. The DC of the poison is instead an opposed roll against (1d20 + 1/2 the rogue’s MPB + the rogue’s intelligence modifier). The rogue may only enhance a single dose of poison per day this way, and poisons only remain enhanced for 24 hours before reverting to their normal state. The rogue may enhance an additional poison per day for every 5 rogue levels she possesses.

In addition, as long as the rogue has 1 stamina remaining, her weapons retain their poison for 1 additional hit plus an additional hit per 5 rogue levels she possesses before the poison wears off the weapon. When applying poison to ammunition she instead learns to apply a single dose of position to an additional piece of ammunition plus an additional per 5 rogue levels she possesses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
