# Class Features

The following are class features of the Steel Savage.
#### Weapon and Armor Proficiency

Steel Savages gain no additional proficiencies with any weapon or armor.
## Stamina

At 1st level, a Steel Savage gains access to a pool of <a href="/Rules/Combat%20Rules/Combat%20Statistics#stamina">stamina</a> points that allow him to perform feats of strength and agility. This pool contains a number of stamina points equal to his Constitution modifier plus his levels in martial classes (minimum 1). This pool replenishes once per day after a long rest.
## Trained Savagery

At 1st level, a Steel Savage may treat his levels in fighter and barbarian as 1 higher for the purposes of determining the power of any barbarian or fighter class features he possesses dependent on class level. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 10th this bonus improves by an additional 1
## Steel Rage

At 1st level, Steel Savage learns to turn his explosive fury inward into a much more cold and calculated rage. When entering a rage a Steel Savage may choose to instead enter a Steel Rage lasting for the same duration as a normal rage. A steel rage grants the steel savage the usual benefits of his rage, and reduces the penalty to AC by 2 (minimum 0).  In addition the steel rage counts as and grants the benefits of the fighter’s Battle Focus talent for the duration of the steel rage. 

The Steel Savage cannot enter a new Battle Focus as part of a rage, and effects that reduce the duration of battle focus reduce the duration of the rage, though abilities that increase the duration of battle focus do not increase the duration of a steel rage. During the steel rage the steel savage’s movement speed is reduced by half (minimum 5 feet). When the Steel Rage ends the Steel Savage is fatigued for the usual duration of a rage.  
## Steel Pressure (Ki)

At 2nd level, the steel savage gains the battle stance fighter talent if he did not already possess it. If the Steel Savage already has, or later gains, the battle stance talent he improves the area of difficult terrain of his battle stance ability to 10 feet; he may still spend a stamina to increase this area as normal.
## Steel Savage Talents

At 2nd level the Steel Savage gains access to Steel Savage Talents when selecting class talents. In addition, the Steel Savage may use his bonus from Trained Savagery to determine his Barbarian and Fighter levels for the purposes of meeting the prerequisites of Fighter or Barbarian talents.

See [Steel Savage Talents](./Steel%20Savage%20Talents/_index.md) for a listing of Talents available for the Primal Chieftain class.
## Aggressions

At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter the Steel Savage gains access to additional Aggressions, as the Barbarian class feature of the same name. These Aggressions can be selected from both those available to the Barbarian, as well as those only available to the Steel Savage. The Steel Savage may use his bonus from Trained Savagery to determine his Barbarian levels for the purposes of meeting the prerequisites of any Aggression.

See [Steel Savage Aggressions](./Steel%20Savage%20Aggressions/_index.md) for a listing of Aggression available to the Steel Savage.
## Steel Body

At 3rd level, the Steel Savage learns to further enhance his durability, adding his levels in Steel Savage to hit maximum hit points. In addition while in a Steel Rage the Steel Savage gains a +1 Bonus to Physical and Reliance Saves, improving by an additional +1 for every 5 levels in Steel Savage you possess.
## Steel Fury

At 4th level, while in a Steel Rage, anytime the steel savage uses an ability that would reduce the duration of battle focus, and by extension the Steel Rage,  the Steel Savage may instead use his Fury pool to pay for the ability, spending 1 fury per round the ability would cost.
## Steel Dodge

At 5th level, a steel savage can react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if helpless or immobilized. A steel savage with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him. At 7th level, a steel savage can no longer be flanked.
## Improved Armor Focus

At 6th level, the Steel Savage gains one of the following benefits based on the armor focus he selected from his fighter armor focus class feature.

- Armored Fortress: The Steel Savage Gains the Heavy Armor Focus if he chose heavy armor, or Light Armor Focus if he chose light armor. He does not gain the additional benefits from this ability for having these additional armor focus.
- Heavy Armor Focus: The Steel Savage gains Armored Fortress ability for heavy armor.
- Light Armor Focus: The Steel Savage gains Armored Fortress ability for light armor.
- Unarmored Focus: The Steel Savage gains the Second Skin fighter talent even if he would not meet the prerequisites.
## Steel Stance

At 7th level, the Steel Savage may treat his Steel Rage as being in Defensive Stance for the purposes of qualifying for feats that would require him to be in Defensive Stance. This does not grant the benefits of Defensive Stance while in a Steel Rage unless he enters the stance, but also does not interfere with the Steel Savage’s battle stance ability. If the Steel Savage does not have Defensive Stance he may still qualify for feats with Defensive Stance as a prerequisite.
## Steel Mind

At 8th level, the Steel Savage may also apply his bonus to Physical and Resilience saves from Steel Body to his Mental saves. In addition, whenever the Steel Savage succeeds at a Mental save he gains a number of temporary hit points equal to his Steel Savage level until the start of his next turn.
## Cold Steel Vengeance (Ki)

At 9th level, once per Steel Rage when a creature successfully strikes the Steel Savage during a steel rage the Steel Savage may choose to spend 1 fury as a reaction to mark the target as his target of vengeance causing them to take cold damage equal to his Endurance modifier (minimum 1). Once a creature has been marked as his target of vengeance the Steel Savage deals additional cold damage equal to his Endurance modifier (minimum 1) on all attacks made with weapons against the target for the duration of his Steel Rage; this additional damage is not multiplied on a critical hit. The mark ends when the Steel Rage ends or the target is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points.
## Adamantine Rage (Su)

At 10th level, once per day the Steel Savage may enter an Adamantine Rage instead of a Steel Rage. While in an Adamantine Rage the Steel Savage gains DR 2/- that stacks with other sources of DR, doubles his bonus from his Trained Savergy class feature, and does not reduce his speed during this rage unlike the Steel Rage. The Adamantine Rage otherwise grants the same benefits and penalties as a Steel Rage. In addition when an attack would reduce the Steel Savage to negative hit points, knock him unconscious, or kill him he may immediately end the Adamantine Rage setting himself at 1 hit point. If a Steel Savage would spend a stamina to cause his rage to continue it instead becomes a Steel Rage and loses the benefits of the Adamantine Rage. Adamantine Rage counts for twice as many rounds as a normal rage for determining how long he is fatigued for; in addition a barbarian is still fatigued after this rage even if his rage would not fatigue him due to his level for rage.
