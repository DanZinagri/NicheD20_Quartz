| Ancestral Focus       | Primal Chieftain 4th  | You may use the reroll of your Ancestral Spirit class feature an additional time per rage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Chieftain's Vengeance | Primal Chieftain 2nd  | When a creature damages the Primal Chieftain within the reach of any ally (other than the Primal Chieftain himself) that enemy provokes an attack of opportunity from yoru allies. Only the enemy, not the Primal Chieftain, needs to be within the ally's melee reach in order for them to make this attack of opportunity. This ability may only be used once per round, and may only be utilized when the Primal Chieftain is using a War Chant by an ally currently receiving the benefits of the War Chant. |
| Effortless Chant      | Primal Chieftain 6th  | You no longer need to spend 1 AP to maintain a War Chant, and it instead lasts the duration of the rage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Hostile Voice         | Primal Chieftain 8th  | When using your Booming Voice ability enemies within the area of the booming voice are subject to a Resilience(End) save attack (1d20+ 1/2 MPB + Endurance Modifier); the Primal Chieftain may apply his weapon's enhancement bonus to this save attack. A successful save attack deals damage equal to half the temporary hit points granted by the Booming Voice.                                                                                                                                              |
| Rejuvenating Chant    | Primal Chieftain 10th | You may spend 1 additional stamina when starting a War Chant to grant all allies under the effects of the war chant Fast Healing 2 for the duration of the War Chant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
