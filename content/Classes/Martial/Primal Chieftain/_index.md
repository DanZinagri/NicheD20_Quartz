# Class Features

The following are class features of the Frenzied Berserker. 
## Weapon and Armor Proficiency

Frenzied Berserker gain no additional proficiencies with any weapon or armor.
## Stamina

At 1st level, a Frenzied Berserker gains access to a pool of <a href="/Rules/Combat%20Rules/Combat%20Statistics/#stamina">stamina</a> points that allow him to perform feats of strength and agility. This pool contains a number of stamina points equal to his Endurance modifier plus levels in martial classes (minimum 1). This pool replenishes once per day after a long rest.
## War Chant

The Primal Chieftain may spend an additional stamina as part of entering a rage to begin a war chant. When the Primal Chieftain begins the war chant all allies currently under the effect of his Tribal Bond receive both the benefits and detriments of his rage.

The Primal Chieftain's allies do not receive the effects of any Barbarian or Primal Chieftain Talents he possesses that grant their effects while raging. The Primal Chieftain's allies may choose to accept or reject this benefit. Allies who leave the area of effect of his Tribal Bond may continue to rage until the end of the Primal Chieftain’s War Chant as long as they can see or hear the Primal Chieftain. Allies may end this rage as a free action as normal and are fatigued for the standard duration, otherwise this ability lasts until the end of the Primal Chieftain’s rage. Allies who initially rejected or ended the War Chant early may not receive this effect again until the Primal Chieftain starts a new War chant.

A war chant is more difficult to maintain than a normal rage, requiring the Primal Chieftain to spend 1 AP each round to continue the War Chant; failure to do so immediately ends the War Chant effects, though the Primal Chieftain may still choose to continue raging for the remainder of their rage duration.

In addition, he may treat his levels in Primal Chieftain as Barbarian levels for the purposes of determining the bonuses and effects of your Barbarian Rage class feature.
## Improved Bond

At 1st level, the Primal Chieftain improves his Tribal Bond. He may treat his levels in Primal Chieftain as Barbarian levels for the purposes of determining the bonuses and effects of his Tribal Bond Barbarian class feature.
## Primal Chieftain Talents

At 2nd level the Primal Chieftain gains access to Primal Chieftain Talents when selecting class talents.

See [Primal Chieftain Talents](./Primal%20Chieftain%20Talents/_index.md) for a listing of Talents available for the Primal Chieftain class.
## Tribal Vengeance

At 2nd level, the Primal Chieftain can make an attack of opportunity against a creature within his reach who damages an ally of the Primal Chieftain (other than the Primal Chieftain himself) with a melee attack. Only the enemy, not the Primal Chieftain’s ally, needs to be within the Primal Chieftain’s melee reach in order for the Primal Chieftain to make this attack of opportunity.
## Aggression

At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter the Primal Chieftain gains access to additional Aggressions, as the Barbarian class feature of the same name. These Aggressions can be selected from both those available to the Barbarian, as well as those only available to the Primal Chieftain. The Primal Chieftain treats his levels as Barbarian levels for the purposes of meeting the prerequisites of any Aggression.

See [Primal Chieftain Aggressions](./Primal%20Chieftain%20Aggressions.md) for a listing of Aggression available to the Primal Chieftain.
## Tribal Coordination

At 3rd level, as long as one other ally is threatening the same foe as the Primal Chieftain the target gains the flanked condition regardless of position. In addition, allies adjacent to the Primal Chieftain also apply their Tribal Bond bonus to AC and saving throw rolls.
## Ancestral Spirit (Ki)

At 4th level, the Primal Chieftain learns to commune with the spirits of his ancestors and tribe to help guide his actions. The Primal Chieftain may once per rage reroll a failed attack, AC check, saving throw, or skill check as a reaction, taking the new result even if it''s worse. The barbarian may use this additional time during the same rage by spending 1 stamina.
## Greater Bond

At 5th level, the area of effect of the Primal Chieftain’s Tribal Bond improves by 10 feet plus an additonal 5 feet per 3 Primal Chieftain levels he possesses. In addition, once per round, the barbarian may spend 1 stamina as 3 AP action to grant all allies under the effects of his tribal bond the ability to move up to their speed or make a single attack. 
## Channel Ancestral Spirit (Ki)

At 6th level, the Primal Chieftain learns to channel the past knowledge and experiences of his ancestors, or even that of a past life to enhance his capabilities.

When the Primal Chieftain rages he may select one combat or martial feat he qualifies for as part of initiating a rage; the Primal Chieftain gains the benefits of the selected feat for the duration of the rage.

In addition, once per day while raging, the Primal Chieftain may pull upon previously unknown knowledge to gain insight into a single creature gaining knowledge as if you had succeeded on a knowledge check against a creature with three degrees of success, and gains a +2 bonus on all rolls against the creature, and creatures of the same type until the edge of his rage.
## Booming Voice

At 7th level, the Primal Chieftain learns to inspire his allies to fight on and ignore pain. As a 3 AP action once per rage the Primal Chieftain may grant all allies within 30 feet of him (including the Primal Chieftain himself) 1d6 temporary hit points per two Primal Chieftain levels he possesses. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute. The barbarian may spend 1 stamina to use this ability an additional time per rage.
## Greater Ancestral Spirit (Ki)

At 8th level, when using Channel Ancestral spirit the Primal Chieftain gains access to an additional combat or martial feat he qualifies for the duration of the ability.

In addition, once per day when performing a War Chant the Primal Chieftain learns to channel this power and knowledge to his allies. When using this ability allies affected by the war chant gain the benefits of any feats granted by the Channel Ancestral Spirit class feature, though these feats have no effect if the creature does not possess the prerequisite feats.
## Rhythm of War

At 9th level, The Primal Chieftain becomes a greater leader and a boon to his allies. When performing a War Chant the Primal Chieftain and any ally under the effects of his War Chant may add his Psyche modifier (minimum 1) to Strength skills, Agility Skills, and Endurance skill checks as well as to all damage rolls for the remainder of the War Chant.
## Tribal Heart (Ki)

At 10th level, the Primal Chieftain learns to become the heart of his tribe. While performing a War Chant the Primal Chieftain may choose to link his vitality to those of his allies. While using this ability anytime any ally would take damage, half of that damage is redirected to the Primal Chieftain. This is only damage that would have damaged the ally's hit points after any DR, Resistances, or Temporary Hit points they may have possessed. The redirected damage bypasses any DR or Resistances the Primal Chieftain possesses, but not any Temporary Hit points he possesses. Damage may only be redirected in this way while the allies remain within the area of the Primal Chieftain's Tribal Bond.
