# Class Features

The following are class features of the Sharpshooter.
## Weapon and Armor Proficiency

Sharpshooter gain no additional proficiencies with any weapon or armor.
## Stamina

At 1st level, a Sharpshooter gains access to a pool of <a href="/Rules/Combat%20Rules/Combat%20Statistics#stamina">stamina</a> points that allow him to perform feats of strength and agility. This pool contains a number of stamina points equal to his Endurance modifier plus levels in martial classes (minimum 1). This pool replenishes once per day after a long rest.

## Sharpshooter's Aim

At 1st level, a Sharpshooter adds his levels in Sharpshooter to his levels in Ranger for determining the effects of his Aim ability from Ranger. In addition whenever the ranger spends AP to perform the Aim action they may roll twice and take the better result of their next attack roll or sight-based perception check made against the creature until the start of their next turn.
## Trained Spotter

At 1st level, a Sharpshooter treats their levels as SPB to determine the progression of their Ranger animal companion (this stacks with SPB gained from other sources for determining the progression of the companion). In addition while adjacent to their Animal Companion they gain a bonus to vision-based perception checks equal to their levels in Sharpshooter for the purposes of spotting creatures.
## Sharpshooter Talents

At 2nd level the Sharpshooter gains access to Sharpshooter Talents when selecting class talents.

For a complete listing of Sharpshooter Talents see [List of Sharpshooter Talents](./List%20of%20Sharpshooter%20Talents.md)
## Rain of Arrows

At 3rd level, the Sharpshooter learns to fire a volley of shots to damage creatures within an area. The Sharpshooter may spend 1 stamina as a 4 AP action to assault an area within the first range increment of his weapon by many falling projectiles. This ability affects a 30 foot area and  deals 1d6 damage per 2 ranger levels possessed; you make a Physical(Agi) save attack against creatures within this area. A failed save attack deals half damage. This ability requires the ranger to be wielding a bow or trigger keyword weapon and consumes 20 ammunition on use.
## Sniper

At 4th level a Sharpshooter learns how to more effectively fire their weapon to get the maximum distance of their weapon. The maximum range increment of bow and trigger keyword weapons is increased by 1. This improves by an additional 1 at 8th and 10th level.
## Homing Arrow

At 5th level, the ranger learns to guide his attacks unerringly towards his target. For 2 stamina as a 4 AP action the ranger may make a single ranged attack against the target of his Ranger’s Mark. This attack may be made even if the ranger does not have line of sight of his target, and the attack may curve around corners or obstacles, though if the attack cannot find a path without an obstacle the attack fails (such as a target being inside of a structure with no open windows or doors). In addition you ignore all attack penalties for range increments for this single attack, but the attack still cannot exceed the maximum range increment of the weapon.

If this attack successfully hits the ranger add twice his Focus modifier to the damage of this attack in addition to the normal damage types.
## Marksman's Accuracy

At 6th level, the Sharpshooter further hones his accuracy even with great obstacles. The Sharpshooter reduces the penalties from shooting enemies behind any cover (except total cover) by half to a minimum of 0.
## Sniper Shot

At 7th level, the Sharpshooter learns to strike at a vital spot to deal extra damage when their foe is unable to properly defend themselves. When attacking a foe with a ranged attack whom is either flat-footed, or has the flanked condition the target takes additional damage equal to 1d10 + the Sharpshooter's Focus modifier from the attack. This damage can only occur on the first hit of a focused attack, or if the Sharpshooter is using the Vital Strike feat. This damage improves by an additional 1d10 for every 2 levels beyond 6 the Sharpshooter possesses.
## Sharpshooter's Eye

At 8th level, the Sharpshooter learns to become more accurate and even greater distances. You reduce the total penalty inured from range increment penalties by 1 for every 3 Sharpshooter levels you possess. This only applies to the final penalty and not the penalty for each separate range increment, for example a bow fired at 3 range increments beyond the first would usually take a -6 penalty, a 6th level sharpshooter would reduce this by 2 making it a -4 penalty. This cannot reduce the range increment penalty below 0.
## Twofold Flurry

At 9th level, the ranger improves the damage of any ranged weapon wielded by learning to shoot an additional ammunition per shot. This attack adds an additional weapon damage die to every shot fired with a bow or trigger keyword weapon and consumes the appropriate amount of extra ammunition. When using this ability attacking in this way imparts an additional -2 penalty to all attacks made in this way and the additional damage is not multiplied on a critical or by abilities that multiply weapon damage dice (such as the Vital Strike feat).
## Impossible Shot (Ki)

At 10th level the Sharpshooter learns to make ranged attacks that are seemingly impossible. The ranger may designate a single attack made against the target of his Ranger’s Mark to become unerring. The attack ignores total cover, or even lack of path as the attack may simply manifest at its destination. The attack ignores the penalties from range increment and may hit a target of up to 1 mile per MPB away as long as they remain affected by the Ranger’s Mark. Attacks made in this way must still roll against the targets defenses as normal. This may be applied to any attack but costs 1 stamina to do so and may only be used a number of times per day equal to the Sharpshooter's Focus modifier (minimum 1). If used in conjunction with the Sharpshooter's homing arrow ability he instead improves the range of this attack to a maximum of 10 miles per MPB.
