Unlike magic classes that have a spell point pool; martial classes possess a <a href="/Rules/Combat%20Rules/Combat%20Statistics/#stamina">stamina</a> pool.

## Martial Prowess Bonus (MPB)

Martial Prowess Bonus is the count of all levels in classes with the stamina class feature. Classes with the stamina feature are considered martial classes. This value is generally used to help determine things such as the scaling of saves for certain effects.
