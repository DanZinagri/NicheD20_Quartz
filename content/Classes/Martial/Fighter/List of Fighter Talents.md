| Adamantine Fortress       | Armor Focus (Armored Fortress)                              | When the fighter rolls initiative he may spend a point of stamina to keep his base defense bonus even when flat footed until he acts for the first time in combat. If the fighter later gains a different ability that allows him to become immune to being flat-footed he instead may use this ability to add his armor bonus to his tough AC until he acts for the first time in combat; this does not stack to other abilities that allows the fighter to apply his armor bonus to his touch AC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

The first successful attack you make in a round grants you a state of Battle Focus; this state of Battle Focus lasts for one minute, and cannot be attained more than once without taking a short rest. While in Battle Focus you gain an additional +1 dodge bonus to AC, and a +1 bonus to Mental saves, improving by 1 every 6 levels of fighter you possess. In addition the fighter may spend a reaction whenever he takes damage to reduce the damage by an amount equal to his levels in fighter, but each time the fighter does he reduces the duration of battle focus by 1 round.                                                                      |

Creatures who begin their turn adjacent to you take 1 fire damage plus an additional 1 fire damage per 4 fighter levels you possess. You may spend 1 stamina as a reaction to channel this heat into your attacks causing them to deal an additional 1d6 + your base attack bonus fire damage until the beginning of your next turn. You may spend 2 stamina to grant this bonus to both the weapons you’re wielding. This additional damage is not multiplied on a crit.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Battle Spirit (Ki)        | Battle Focus talent                                         | You may spend 1 stamina at the beginning of your turn as a free action to immediately enter Battle Focus even if you have yet to successfully attack a foe. In addition, when in Battle Focus the fighter may spend 1 stamina as a reaction to grant his weapon a +1 enhancement bonus while he maintains Battle Focus; this bonus may stack with any enhancement bonus currently on the weapon (though not with itself). This Enhancement bonus increases by 1 per 3 fighter levels he possesses.<br><br>When the fighter uses this ability, the total enhancement bonus of the enhancement bonus of the weapon cannot exceed +5; but attacks with the weapon ignores 1 point of DR a creature possesses for every +1 the weapon would have gone above +5. |

This is treated as a stance feat for the purposes of maintaining this Battle Stance and other stance feats. While in Battle Stance you cause all squares adjacent to you to be treated as difficult terrain by foes. You may spend 1 stamina during your turn as a 2 AP action to double this area of difficult terrain.<br><br>As long as the fighter remains in combat he gains 1 round at the start of each turn to the duration of his battle focus while he is in Battle Stance and in Battle Focus.                                                                                                                                                          |

Your Battle Focus immediately ends as soon as this attack resolves, as well as any other benefits you would have for being in Battle Focus. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter this ability deals an additional 1 point of damage per talent you possess with battle focus as a prerequisite.                                                                                                                                                                                              |

In addition, once per battle focus you may spend 1 stamina as a 2 action to heal a number of hit points equal to 1d6 + your levels in fighter, but doing so reduces the duration of your battle focus by 2 rounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
