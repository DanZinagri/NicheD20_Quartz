# Class Features

The following are class features of the fighter.
## Weapon and Armor Proficiency

A fighter is proficient with all simple weapons and armor. If this is the character’s first level in a class he gains proficiency in all martial weapons and armor.
## Stamina

At 1st level, a fighter gains access to a pool of <a href="/Rules/Combat%20Rules/Combat%20Statistics/#stamina">stamina</a> points that allow him to perform feats of strength and agility. This pool contains a number of stamina points equal to his Endurance modifier plus his levels in martial classes (minimum 1). This pool replenishes once per day after a long rest.
## Combat Stance

If this is the character’s first level in a martial class, the fighter gains two bonus stance feats of their choice that they qualify for.
## Martial Training

At 1st, 2nd, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as Combat Feats or Martial feats.
## Fighter’s Flexibility

At 2nd level, a fighter may spend 1 stamina as a 2 AP action to gain the benefit of a single martial or combat feat he qualifies for but does not possess for 1 minute. Additional uses of this ability replaces the feat with a different choice; while also refreshing the duration of the ability to the full minute again. If a feat has a use limitation, any uses of that combat feat while using this ability count toward that feat’s limit, even if that feat is lost and regained at a later point in the same day.

At 8th level, the fighter may use this ability to gain the benefit of feats at the same time instead of one; the fighter may use one of the feats to meet a prerequisite of the second feat. At 12th level the AP cost of this ability is reduced by 1. At 15th level this improves to three feats. At 20th level this improves to four feats.
## Fighter Talent

At 2nd level the Fighter gains access to Fighter Talents when selecting class talents.

## Armor Focus

At 3rd level, a fighter learns to focus in a style of armor to further draw upon the strengths and minimize the weaknesses of each. A fighter selects one of the following:

| Name              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Armored Fortress  | A fighter may treat his AC bonus from his armor 1 higher for the purposes of how much damage he may redirect to his armor from an attack. In addition he may treat up to 1 point of precision damage as normal damage for the purpose of determining what damage his armor may redirect. Every four levels after 3rd increases these bonuses by an additional 1. When selecting this ability, the fighter chooses light or heavy armor for which this ability applies to.                                                                         |
| Heavy Armor Focus | A fighter may treat his AC bonus from his armor 1 higher for the purposes of how much damage he may redirect to his armor from an attack. In addition he may treat up to 1 point of precision damage as normal damage for the purpose of determining what damage his armor may redirect. Every four levels after 3rd increases these bonuses by an additional 1. When selecting this ability, the fighter chooses light or heavy armor for which this ability applies to.                                                                         |
| Light Armor Focus | Whenever he is wearing light armor, he may apply his half his armor’s armor bonus (including enhancement bonuses) to his touch AC, stacking with the nimble property if the armor possesses it. At 10th level the fighter may apply his full armor bonus to his touch AC; also stacking with the bonus from nimble.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Unarmored Focus   | When the fighter is unarmored and unencumbered the fighter gains a +1 shield bonus to AC. Every four levels after 3rd increases these bonuses by an additional 1. In addition, once per day when the fighter uses the Roll With It stamina ability to reroll an AC roll he may treat a failure by less than one degree on the reroll as a successful AC roll; or treat failure by two degrees or less as a failure by one degree or less. The fighter may use this ability an additional time per day at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter. |

## Armed Expertise

At 4th level, the fighter may treat his base attack bonus as 1 higher for the purposes of feats he may qualify for. This bonus increases by 1 at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter.

In addition the Fighter gains Quick Draw (Martial) as a bonus feat if he did not already possess it. If the Fighter already would have Quick Draw he instead gains a different martial feat of he choice he would qualify for.
## Weapon Training

Starting at 5th level, a fighter selects one of the following keywords: Blade, Dueling, Hammer, Spear, Axe, Bow, Flail, Throwing, Trigger, Polearm, Monastic, Shield, or Sling.

Whenever he attacks with a weapon with this keyword, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls. Every four levels after 5th these bonuses increase by +1 each. This bonus also applies to MSB for maneuvers made with the weapon, as well as the fighter’s saves when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against his weapons with this keyword.

At 10th level the fighter may select an additional weapon keyword to apply these bonuses to. Bonuses granted from multiple keywords on the same weapon do not stack.
## Signature Feat

At 7th level, a fighter may select a single feat he possesses, he may treat his base attack bonus a 2 higher for the purposes of any effects of that feat that are dependent on base attack bonus. This does not increase the Fighter’s base attack bonus for the purposes of determining his bonus to attack rolls when using the chosen feat. At 10th level the fighter increases this bonus by an additional +2 as well as may select an additional feat. Each time the fighter selects a new feat he may also choose a different feat in place of a feat he’s previously selected.
## Stance Expertise

At 9th level, the fighter learns to maintain two stances at once; and may enter two stances at once using a single reaction when first entering a stance. If the fighter possesses the Stance Mastery combat feat or later gains it he may treat the number of stances he is attempting to maintain as one lower for the purposes of determining the number of reactions required the maintain the additional stances. 
## Greater Stamina

At 10th level, the fighter gains improvements to the <a href="/Rules/Combat%20Rules/Combat%20Statistics/#stamina">stamina</a> abilities available to those with a stamina pool.

- Second Wind: Once per day, when the fighter uses a second wind he may spend an additional stamina point to instead gain his Endurance modifier per 2 hit dice as direct healing, with healing over his maximum hit points being applied as Temporary hit points that last for 1 minute.
- Extra Effort: A number of times per day equal to the fighter's Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) he may apply this ability to an attack roll or save attack; this must be done before the result of the attack or save attack has been revealed.
- Marching Stamina:  You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to half your Endurance modifier (minimum 1) without spending stamina.
- Roll With It: If the new roll succeeds you reduce the incoming damage by half and convert the remainder into nonlethal.
- Unarmored Duelist: You may spend 1 stamina when using this ability to designate an additional number of targets with this ability equal to your Focus modifier (minimum 1).
