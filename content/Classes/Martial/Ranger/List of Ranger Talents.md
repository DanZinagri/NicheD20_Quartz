| Bore Shot              | Piercing Shot talent, Ranger 6th            | The ranger’s may choose to spend 1 stamina as a reaction when making an attack to allow the attack to benefit from piercing shot even if it does not slay the creature; in addition when using piercing shot within this way the creature begins to take bleed damage equal to the base damage of the weapon used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Disarming Shot         | Ranger 4th                                  | The ranger may attempt a disarm attempt with a bow or trigger keyword ranged weapon attack at a -2 penalty against a weapon the creature is currently holding. If successful the weapon drops into a square of the ranger’s choice within 10 feet of the creature hit plus an additional 5 feet per degree of success on the maneuver. if the ranger is in the chosen square they may choose to catch the weapon instead of letting it fall to the ground.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Elemental Prowess (Ki) | Ranger 7th, Empowered Arrow hunter training | The ranger’s empowered arrow is now always active and does not require a point of stamina to begin; instead the effect applies to any weapon he is currently wielding but the effect no longer applies to any weapon he is no longer holding. The damage from the empowered arrow ability improves to 2d6. In addition if the ranger is capable of choosing multiple elements for his empowered arrow ability he may choose which element his weapon deals on each attack it makes; this damage is based on the affinity talent’s associated element.                                                                                                                                         |
| Empowered Arrow (Ki)   | Ranger 4th                                  | The ranger may spend 1 stamina as a 1 AP action to imbue his currently wielded weapon with elemental energies. The attacks with this weapon deal an additional 1d6 nature damage for a number of rounds equal to the ranger’s Focus modifier. If the ranger has other elemental affinity talents he may instead deal damage of that type instead of nature damage, choosing the type when he starts using this ability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Favored Command        | Hunter’s Command                            | Select a single command from the list of commands from Hunter’s Command; once per round the ranger may reduce the AP or Stamina cost of that command by 1. If this would reduce the AP cost to 0 it instead becomes a reaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Favored Terrain        | \-                                          | When selecting this hunter training the ranger may select a type of terrain from the list of terain types.<br><br>The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (region), Perception, Stealth, Tenacity, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses). If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger’s bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.<br><br>This hunter training may be selected more than once, each time selecting a new type of terrain. |
| Mounted Stability      | Mount companion talent.                     | You gain the Mounted Archery (Martial) feat as a bonus feat. In addition you may treat your ranks in Ride as 10 higher for the purposes of benefits from this feat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Parting Shot           | Ranger 4th                                  | The ranger may spend 1 stamina as a 3 AP  action to make a single attack at his highest base attack bonus against a creature adjacent to him with a ranged weapon he is wielding. If the ranger successfully hits the target he may deal damage as normal and make a DC 10 acrobatics check. For every degree of success the ranger may move 5 feet away from the target of this attack up to a maximum distance equal to his speed. The ranger does not provoke an attack of opportunity for this movement.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Piercing Shot          | \-                                          | Anytime a ranger’s attack with a bow or trigger keyword weapon would slay a creature or reduce them to 0 or fewer hit points the ranger may choose to have the attack continue an additional 5 feet per ranger level beyond the target to strike another creature within a line from the ranger and the original creature. The next creature hit by this is subject to the same attack roll as the first but at a -2 penalty. This attack cannot pierce a second time and cannot exceed the maximum range increment of the weapon.                                                                                                                                                            |
| Pistol Whip            | Ranger 4th                                  | The ranger’s melee attacks with his ranged weapons are no longer considered improvised and deals damage equal to the weapon's damage dice; though the damage type changes to bludgeoning when used as a melee weapon and has a crit of 20/x2. This only applies to ranged weapons being used as improvised melee weapons and not combination weapons with both a ranged and melee component.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Point Blank            | Ranger 4th, Aim                             | The ranger may now apply the bonuses from his aim ability to his melee weapon attacks as well as his ranged weapon attacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Split Shot             | Ranger 6th                                  | Whenever the ranger makes a Focused Attack with a bow keyword weapon he may make a bonus attack against a different creature at a -2 penalty                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

He takes only a –10 penalty (instead of the normal –20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
