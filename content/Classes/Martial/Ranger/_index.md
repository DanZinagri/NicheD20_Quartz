# Class Features

The following are class features of the ranger.

## Weapon and Armor Proficiency

A ranger is proficient with all simple weapons and armor. If this is the character’s first level in a class he gains proficiency in all light martial armor. In addition the ranger may gain proficiency in their choice of a single martial bow keyword weapon, martial or exotic trigger keyword weapon, or thrown keyword weapons.
## Stamina

At 1st level, a ranger gains access to a pool of <a href="/Rules/Combat%20Rules/Combat%20Statistics/#stamina">stamina</a> points that allows her to perform feats of strength and agility. This pool contains a number of stamina points equal to his Endurance modifier plus his levels in martial classes (minimum 1). This pool replenishes once per day after a long rest.
## Ranger’s Precision

If this is the character’s first level in a martial class, the ranger gains Power Stance and Precision Stance as bonus stance feats.
## Tracker’s Training

At 1st level, the ranger may select any two of the following: perception, ride, survival, stealth, or a knowledge skill; the ranger gains a +1 class bonus in the selected skills improving by an additional 1 at 4th level and levels thereafter.
## Aim

At 1st level, the Ranger learns to focus their senses as a 2 AP action gaining a +1 insight bonus on all attack and damage rolls against a single target he can see, and treats their crit range of their weapon as 1 higher (20 becomes 19-20, 19-20 becomes 18-20, etc...). These bonuses only apply on ranged weapon attacks against this target, and last until the start of their next turn. The ranger may spend 1 stamina to reduce the AP cost of this action by 1 (minimum 0 AP).

At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter the ranger increases the insight bonus on attack and damage rolls with aim by an additional 1.

At 10th level the ranger may use this ability as a 1 AP action.
## Animal Companion

At 1st level, the Ranger forms a bond with an animal companion. It gains a companion as described on the companion page treating thier levels in ranger as SPB to determine the progression of this companion (this stacks with SPB gained from other sources for determining the progression of the companion). If any companion ability or talent would cost spell points from the caster, they instead cost an equal amount of the ranger’s stamina.

When gaining this companion, the Ranger selects either Arachnid, Avian, Beast, or Serpent; once chosen the Ranger is treated as having the selected form talent for the purposes of determining the form and traits of the companion. In addition the companion automatically gains the Animal type as its companion type. The companion gains these types and form even if the ranger does not meet the prerequisites.

If a ranger releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 16 uninterrupted hours usually in prayer or performing a ritual in the environment where the new companion typically lives.

While companions can take many forms a ranger’s animal companion should usually have a form similar to that of a non-magical animal (wolf, tiger, hawk, horse, etc..) though the GM may allow for other creatures. If the setting would allow the GM may allow a Ranger to take the Aquatic companion type but must treat it as an Aquatic Animal (with the reduced Intelligence) and may take the Aquatic form as its base form.
## Ranger Talents

At 2nd level the Ranger gains access to Ranger Talents when selecting class talents.

For a complete listing of Ranger Talents see [[List of Ranger Talents|List of Ranger Talents]]
## Animal Focus

At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter the ranger may chose a single animal focus talent allowing them to further enhance the abilities of their companion.

For a complete list of Foci see [[List of Animal Foci|List of Animal Foci]]
## Ranger's Mark (Ki)

At 3rd level, the Ranger learns to supernaturally mark his foes making it more difficult for them to escape. Once per day, when hitting a target with an attack that the Ranger has successfully used Aim on the Ranger may spend 1 stamina as a reaction to mark the target. Once marked the foe is treated as being the target of the ranger's aim ability for the duration of the mark, and the ranger gains a +5 bonus on survival checks to track the target. This mark lasts for 1 hour per Ranger level. At 9th level the ranger may use this ability an additional time per day. Additional applications of this ability on a new target immediately ends the mark on the previous target.

In addition, the Ranger gains Rapid Reload (Martial) as a bonus feat. If he already possesses this feat he may instead select a different martial feat of his choice that he would qualify for.
## Hunter’s Command

At 5th level the ranger learns to push their companion to even greater action allowing for better tactical cooperation. Each round the hunter may choose to perform one of the following actions, though each action may require a different type of action or scenario to utilize the hunter may still only perform one per round.

- **Reposition**: Once per round as a 1 AP action you may command your animal companion causing it to move up to its speed. Your animal companion must be able to hear you and capable of moving for you to use this ability. You may use this ability an additional time per round by spending 1 stamina. This action is a bonus action for the animal companion and does not spend any additional actions for the companion.
- **Strike**: Once per round as a 2 AP action you may command your animal companion to make a single attack against a creature within range of it. You may direct the animal companion to attack a specific creature you can see though the creature must be within range of the companion to attack, otherwise it will attempt to make an attack against a random hostile  creature adjacent to it. Your animal companion must be able to hear you for you to use this ability. You may spend 1 stamina to use this ability an additional time per round. This action is a bonus action for the animal companion and does not spend any additional actions for the companion.
- **Cover**: When you would perform an action that would provoke an attack of opportunity while your animal companion is adjacent to you, you may once per round as a reaction direct your companion to interfere causing any attack of opportunity taken against that action to have a 50% chance to miss, but attacks that miss due to this miss chance instead target the animal companion. This benefit is only active for a single triggering action as well as only active while the animal companion remains adjacent to you. You may use this ability an additional time per round by spending 1 stamina. This action is a bonus action for the animal companion and does not spend any additional actions for the companion.
- **Frightening Howl**: You may spend 1 stamina to command your companion as a 3 AP action to make a frightening howl, roar, or other aggressive or unnerving action. Roll a Knowledge(Nature) check, enemies within 30 feet of your animal companion who can hear it are subject to a demoralize attempt using your Knowledge(Nature) check as the intimidate check. This action is a bonus action for the animal companion and does not spend any additional actions for the companion.
## Hunter's Mark

At 7th level, the ranger gains further utility from their Ranger's Mark ability. Targets marked by the Ranger's Mark causes attacks against the creature made by the Ranger's allies to gain half the ranger's Aim bonus to all attack rolls against that target, though the Ranger's Animal Companion gains the full bonus to attack rolls instead of only half.

In addition, the ranger gains additional bonuses from their Ranger's Mark. The ranger now ignores the detriments of cover and may roll twice and take the better result for any miss chance against the target. The bonus to survival checks to track the target now last 1 day per Ranger level even after the other bonuses from the Ranger's Mark have already ended. This bonus can still only affect one creature at a time, and targeting a new creature with a Ranger's Mark still immediately ends these bonuses.
## Hawkeye

At 9th level, the Ranger learns to further their prowess with ranged weapons increasing the range increment of any thrown, crossbow, bow, or firearm keyword weapons by 10ft.
## Deadeye Shot

At 10th level, a Ranger learns to take careful aim for a single deadly shot.

The ranger gains Vital Strike feat as a bonus feat even if he would not meet the prerequisites; if the ranger already possesses this feat or later gains it the ranger may instead treat their base attack bonus from their ranger levels as equal to their levels in ranger for the purposes of determining the benefits of this feat, though this does not affect the attack roll made with this feat.

When using the vital strike feat to make an attack the ranger automatically gains the benefit of their Aim ability against the target for no additional action. 

In addition, when spending additional AP to add additional weapon damage dice to the vital strike you may instead choose to make an additional attack roll. This attack roll is against the same AC as the first vital strike attack roll. Each successful attack deals the ranger's aim bonus damage an additional time in addition to the normal effects of spending additional AP on the vital strike. A failed hit instead adds no additional damage or weapon damage effectively wasting the additional AP spent. Critical hits made this way turn the attack into a critical hit even if the original attack roll wasn't, this only multiplies the base damage of the weapon as normal and not the additional damage of the vital strike. For each additional critical beyond the first with this vital strike you may treat the critical multiplier of the weapon as 1 higher.
