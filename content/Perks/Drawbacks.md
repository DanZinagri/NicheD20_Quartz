title: Drawbacks
---
Drawbacks are character-defining traits that have both a positive and negative affect on your character, usually to show some sort of detriment that a character has found to use to their advantage. These may be taken in place of perks; marked individually as a major or minor drawback. Drawbacks are designed to have a negative impact on your character, but as a trade should give a benefit that either balances against the drawback or at least allows a character to cope with the drawback better than others. This is generally a system to facilitate thematics rather than allotting raw power to a character, but as the character is gaining benefits some restrictions do exist on this as well.

Characters are normally allotted 1 major drawback or 2 minor drawbacks in addition to their normal perk selections. These do not allow a character to take additional major or minor perks beyond their normal limits, and instead are taken in place of their listed type, major drawbacks in place of major perks and minor drawbacks in place of minor perks. A GM may allow a player to take more drawbacks beyond the normal allotment without needing to trade their perks.

| Blindness       | You’ve been blind for a very long time and have adapted to it. You are permanently blind and even the strongest of magics seem unable to restore your sight. But due to this you’ve adapted to this condition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | You gain the blind warrior stance as a bonus feat.

| Deaf            | You’ve been deaf for a very long time and have adapted to it. You are permanently deaf and even the strongest of magics seem unable to restore your hearing. But due to this you’ve adapted to this condition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | You reduce the DC of reading other creatures' lips to DC 15. In addition you may use sleight of hand in place of bluff to pass secret messages, but may also use the pass secret messages ability to communicate with other creatures. In addition you gain a +5 bonus to saves against all Sonic keyword abilities.                                                        |
| Fear of Failure | A natural 2 is now also considered an automatic failure for attack rolls, ac rolls, combat maneuvers, save attacks, or saving throws.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | You may take a 10 on these types of rolls once per day plus an additional time per day per 3 hit dice you possess, regardless of the circumstances you’re in, due to your ability to be more careful.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Mute            | You are unable to speak, grunt, or make much if any sound from your mouth;  nor can you provide verbal components to any spells you cast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | You must use sleight of hand in place of bluff to pass secret messages, but may also use the pass secret messages ability to communicate with other creatures.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Procrastinator  | You have a knack for putting things off until later, and end up paying the price as a result. Pick an interaction that is important for your character approved by your GM; you have a 10% chance to have not done that task (such as forgetting to prepare that spell slot, buy arrows, reload your gun, etc..). This occurs when you attempt to perform an action related to that task (such as casting a spell, knocking an arrow, or firing your gun, etc…). The GM should help determine the type of action to ensure it is something that can occur somewhat commonly for the character. | You are such an adept procrastinator that all status conditions are delayed 1 round before affecting the character. This does not count against the duration of the status conditions but rather simply delays its onset by 1 round. Effects that can cleanse such status conditions may still affect the character and cleanse the status condition before it would apply. |

| Bulky                 | Your great bulk of body through either bone, muscle, or general corpulence makes it harder for you to get through some places. You take a -4 penalty on stealth checks and cannot squeeze into spaces smaller than your own without magical assistance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Due to your increased bulk you are more sturdy and gain 1 additional hit point per four character levels you possess and gain a +2 bonus to saves against grapple maneuvers.                                                                                                                   |
| Graceless             | You must make a DC 13 + ½ hit dice acrobatics check or fall prone in any round you move more than half your movement speed at the end of your movement. In addition you increase the AP cost of standing up from prone by 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | You reduce the penalties to AC and attack rolls for being prone by 2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Old Wound             | Inclimate weather (such as snow or rain) causes your old wounds to ache. During these types of weather you take a -5 penalty to your move speed and must make a DC 15 + ½ character level concentration check to cast spells during this time due to the aches and pains you feel.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | You are aware 24 hours in advance if the weather will become rainy or snowy as well as vaguely if it will be light or heavy rain/snow.                                                                                                                                                         |
| Packrat               | You must make a Mental save (DC 10 + ½ character level) anytime you wish to sell an item, or use a limited use resource (such as a potion). If you fail this save you must instead hold onto the item instead of selling or using it and may not attempt again for another 24 hours for that item.                                                                                                                                                                                   | You reduce the penalties for medium and heavy encumbrance to half their usual severity.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Short Legs            | Your legs are quite short for your race. Your movement speed is reduced by 10 (minimum 5).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Your lower center of gravity has made you harder to trip, granting you a +2 to saves against trip attempts.
